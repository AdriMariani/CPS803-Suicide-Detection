9670,"I think this might be my suicide letterI wrote this a while back, but my feelings haven't changed.

&amp;#x200B;

 Can't really think of a reason to get out of bed today. I think this might be what a downward spiral is all about. Anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life.

&amp;#x200B;

The want to want.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never been a driven guy. I have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo. I chose what university to go to with little to no research, I chose a major simply because I had to, I am who I am, where I am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is I don’t want that. I have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking. With the GPA I have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim. I’ll get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title that’ll do little but stroke my ego because in reality I’ll spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk. I see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but I can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a self made millionaire, born in a small European town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all A\*s (I remember my sister crying because she only got an A on something in school, she thought she’d never go to university.) Me? I pat myself on the back when I go to all my classes in a week, or when I didn’t do as bad on the test I didn’t study for as I thought I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m constantly surrounded by people who’s average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward. I have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, I have found myself simply drifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m not sure where to go from here. I am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it. I want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but I don’t. Every second of every day feels like I am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldn’t be just waiting.",suicide,"i think this might be my suicide letteri wrote this a while back, but my feelings haven t changed  amp x200b  can t really think of a reason to get out of bed today i think this might be what a downward spiral is all about anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life  amp x200b  the want to want  amp x200b  i have never been a driven guy i have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo i chose what university to go to with little to no research, i chose a major simply because i had to, i am who i am, where i am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society   amp x200b  the issue is i dont want that i have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking with the gpa i have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim ill get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title thatll do little but stroke my ego because in reality ill spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk i see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but i can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by   amp x200b  my father is a self made millionaire, born in a small european town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all a s i remember my sister crying because she only got an a on something in school, she thought shed never go to university  me? i pat myself on the back when i go to all my classes in a week, or when i didnt do as bad on the test i didnt study for as i thought i had  amp x200b  im constantly surrounded by people whos average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward i have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, i have found myself simply drifting   amp x200b  i guess im not sure where to go from here i am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it i want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but i dont every second of every day feels like i am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldnt be just waiting ",509

14762,"I want to end it all because death would be better than life???Right, so here we go. I'm a 13 year old girl, and I go to a top-notch private school in AUS. I'm like a terrible kid; I slam doors, I scream, I try and run away. And when I do those things, my parents punish me, they have a right to.

But their punisment methods are what hurt the most. Twice in the past year, my dad's hit me on the head so hard that I've gone dizzy and thrown up. Just yesterday, my mum beat me with a shoe until my back and right arm were sore and I was begging her to stop but she wouldn't.

Also, there's verbal punisment. My parents threaten to kill/hurt me continuously. My mum constantly tells me that she would kill herself if it wasn't for my sister, whom she loves dearly and would never do this to me. She also tells me how she would like to set me on fire, break my neck, kill me etc.

Recently, I've wanted to end my life more and more times. It just seems like nothing will get better, ever, and everything's my fault. Everything hurts, and I've seriously contemplated suicide a few times, though I know I'll never do it.

Yesterday, in the car, my mum yelled at me, and I was crying in the backseat. a truckie saw me, looked at me, but he didn't do anything. He. Didn't. Do. Anything. I've thought of him over and over, and each time I do, it hurts even worse. I've spent nights in the bathroom because I know if I go out, I will leave my house in the back of an ambulance.

Mostly, though, my parents are really nice. They buy me a lot of things, pay heighty school fees. This stuff happens only rarely. But when it happens, it's terrible, and I don't like it, and I'm begging for my life. Y'know, I think they like seeing me beg, sometimes force me onto my knees.

I know I'm probably just another spoilt little kid in your eyes, and I'm too old to be considered a child anymore, but to me, it's really serious. I'm actually scared for my life here. One day, I'm sure my parents will do something we'll both regret.

Yesterday, I called DHS, and my parents found out. They told me about all they've done for me, and said that I was a stupid, ungrateful slut who, if it was legal, they would have killed by now. I felt so ashamed, and wanted to die again.
Sorry for it being long, but seriously, what do I do? I'm barely a teenager, yet here I am, being so hurt. Please, tell me what to do.

15682,"[SW] Should we really be allowing posts that claim to have already ""committed suicide"" ? Is this causing more harm than good?When there are posts made here that are basically ""Hey I just took a bunch of sleeping pills, this is my last post, good bye!"", and then the OP doesn't actually respond to anything further, it leads to several possibilities:

1. Maybe they really did commit suicide, and they are using r/SW as a place to announce it. This place then becomes an announcement board for people who have actually committed suicide rather than a place to help them. Is that really the role we want to have?

2. If someone is really committing suicide, and using r/SW as a place to announce it, then they are getting the postmortem attention that they desire and they feel satisfaction in doing so. It is like their final message to the world, and r/SW is serving as a platform for that final message. 

3. This could encourage other people ""on the fence"" to go through with it, and actually commit suicide. It can't possibly be helpful for someone who is actually considering suicide to see a post like like that. They won't get any positive benefit from it. Seeing someone else do something you are thinking about doing can give you just enough of a push over the edge to cause you to do it also.

4. It could be trolling, and a way to play with the emotions of people on r/SW. I am sure at least some of those posts are trolls, and again even if they aren't trolls, it is certainly doing no one any good. In any case, troll or not, it serves absolutely no purpose for anyone.

5. If the OP never responds, it leaves people who have responded to that post feeling bad. Maybe they couldn't say just the right thing, maybe they didn't get there in time, etc. It is harmful for members of r/SW to see posts like that, to genuinely consider that maybe another human being has taken their life, and be totally powerless to help.

I propose two suggestions regarding this:

1. I propose that we discourage any such posts using posting guidelines. If anyone makes such a post, they should receive a very kindly worded message explaining the reasoning behind why such posts are disallowed, encouraging them to call a medical center. They are welcome to make a new post, or maybe even the mods can make a new post on their behalf.

2. It should be r/SW policy to alert the authorities any time such a post is made, including Reddit admins, the police, etc. This also could be enough to help discourage trolls from posting here knowing there could be real world consequences to them.

To summarize: I feel that posts on r/SW where people are NOT here looking for help, but who are announcing their own suicides, should not be allowed for all of the reasons listed above.

Thoughts?

4136,"Free, no BS, tutoring office hours style on twitch. I'll be around for the next two hours or so if you have any questions that I might be able to help with  

Right off the bat, this is 100% completely free. I don't ask for donations and I don't want donations. I am so committed to this that I have promised to donate any money received to charity, and I'll post the receipt on the discord to prove it.

Now that's out of the way, Hi! I'm Arch, a college graduate waiting to get into medical school. In this next year I want to give back a little bit to the community and thought that tutoring could be a useful service to offer. My sister is a teacher, and she's told me that the pandemic has been really hard on a lot of students. That is why I am offering office-hours-style tutoring on twitch. I figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. I am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy. That means I have plenty of experience with the core three sciences and can (hopefully) help explain some of the more difficult concepts to you should you need some assistance.

Again, this is not for money or for karma or for clout. Show up for five minutes, ask a question, and leave without a second glance or follow or whatever. This is supposed to be a no pressure environment where students can get some additional help if they need it. Come and check it out if you want or send the link on to a friend if you know they are struggling with something in school. Absolutely no personal information is required. No names, no emails. Jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. There are no stupid questions. All I ask is that you be kind and courteous to anyone else in the stream and that you forgive me if I cannot answer your question.

(I am not going to do your homework for you. Just want to help with conceptual issues.)

The twitch is [twitch.tv/archexplains](https://twitch.tv/archexplains)

I want this to be a resource that anyone can use for a quick question or for in depth help. If you have any ways that I could improve the service please do not hesitate to let me know.

freshman year of highschool was a dark time for me. simply because i had just moved from my hometown to a place i know little of. my friends back at home have been with me for most of my childhood and elementary years. they were a second family that didn't look down on me for such simple mistakes. people in the city where i studied high school at spoke a different dialect. i could only communicate in english for some time. even while i was alone and aware that these people saw me as an outsider, small acts kept me going. acts such as lending an eraser or a correction pen gave me a ray of hope that i will eventually get along well with them in a way similar to my friends back at home. even when i was sinking deeper and deeper into a state of where nothing mattered, when a classmate greeted me a good morning, i would lighten up a bit and nod or greet them back. it was as if they knew my situation and was helping me in a small way. that's just an as if though, for the rest of the day they would spend their time with their friend group and i would be sitting on my chair reading a book or trying to catch up on lessons. i don't know why such small acts can make a person like me happy. 

they mean nothing to the person who directed them so why does it have such an impact on me? heck, even a baby smiling at me at 7-11 was enough to make me smile a bit. even  an upperclassman asking me if i would like to go ahead in line made me felt acknowledged . and even a classmate asking me a simple favor made me feek important to someone. acts like these are the reason why im still here searching even more for an answer to such emotions. thank you for being here.",suicide,"some phenomena that keep me goingthis is my second time posting here and apologies in advance if my grammar and spelling is off i ll probably delete this when i feel like it once again pressure from peers, superiors, and relatives build up again im still struggling with online classes i know im not the person i was yesterday i seem to have gotten worse as the days pass by and i can clearly see it in myself i would rather sit at my table and study than get up and take a proper shower back to what i was here for, im still having contemplations of how im gonna go i don t have an exact plan in mind like i did before i just know that death is the last resort it ll be an escape from this place i live in and the experiences i experience but aside from the bad experiences, there are some that i can actuallu feel calm with  hence the title of this post  freshman year of highschool was a dark time for me simply because i had just moved from my hometown to a place i know little of my friends back at home have been with me for most of my childhood and elementary years they were a second family that didn t look down on me for such simple mistakes people in the city where i studied high school at spoke a different dialect i could only communicate in english for some time even while i was alone and aware that these people saw me as an outsider, small acts kept me going acts such as lending an eraser or a correction pen gave me a ray of hope that i will eventually get along well with them in a way similar to my friends back at home even when i was sinking deeper and deeper into a state of where nothing mattered, when a classmate greeted me a good morning, i would lighten up a bit and nod or greet them back it was as if they knew my situation and was helping me in a small way that s just an as if though, for the rest of the day they would spend their time with their friend group and i would be sitting on my chair reading a book or trying to catch up on lessons i don t know why such small acts can make a person like me happy  they mean nothing to the person who directed them so why does it have such an impact on me? heck, even a baby smiling at me at 7 11 was enough to make me smile a bit even an upperclassman asking me if i would like to go ahead in line made me felt acknowledged  and even a classmate asking me a simple favor made me feek important to someone acts like these are the reason why im still here searching even more for an answer to such emotions thank you for being here ",508
11657,"Idealizing suicide from a young age (20F)This isn't a call for help. I have been through years of therapy and have learned how to cope with the thoughts that will never truly go away.

I have always idealized the thought of committing suicide, and have attempted twice in the past. Once when I was 16, and then right after I graduated High School at 18. I was in pain, suffered through years of emotional trauma and sexual assault as a child. My biological mother is a narcissist, with a very bad taste in men. She tends to latch onto those who turn out abusive but have money, then calls it 'love' and forced that love onto me. 

I was raped by her current husband when I was 14. I never told her until after my father took her to court to get custody of me at 16. She didn't believe me, called me a liar and said I ruined her husband's life. No charges were made against her husband, there was nothing put on his record per my request- I was angry at him for stealing my childhood innocence from me, but what good would it have to be angry? I stewed in that anger for years, self-hatred internalized and self blame rapidly consuming my every thought.

After my second attempt, I started to depend on the thoughts instead of the action. I've been in therapy for about.. 4 years now, and have been told that writing down my feelings should help- there are probably lots of posts by me about the topic of my biological mother. 

Recently, memories of my childhood have resurfaced after recent therapy sessions. The reason why I have never seemed comfortable around my older brother (24M), why I never got along with him well. Memories resurfaced and I could vaguely remember being in a hotel room with my family, I think I was really young, probably 8-9, when he grabbed my hand and forced me to touch him inappropriately. I remember yanking my hand away and then the memories fade out into fuzziness. 

I don't want to tell my father because it was so long ago, but the memories are eating at me and my head keeps telling me that the best way to go is suicide- but I know I won't go through with it.

1049,"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.

So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow.

9760,"Please help pull me out of this black hole...I apologize for the long text.

I have struggled with minor depression most of my life and taking my own life has always floated in my head during those dark times. And in a sense, I always knew I would go out this way. Luckily, I have always been able to check it and control it and get myself out of the hole after a couple of days. Recently, life has been going amazing. Healthy relationship with an amazing person who is the most self-less person I have ever met, job is good, friends are great, and have become emotionally strong. And I finally thought I had gotten out of that black hole so many of us know too well. I was HAPPY!!

Now I'm in such a dark place. I'm in this dark place that I can't escape and I can't talk to anyone. I'm now 29 years old and I've spent my whole life since being a teenager making conscious choices to be good to people and treat everyone I come in contact with with respect for no other reason than because we should be good to each other. I can honestly look myself in the mirror and tell myself that I am a good person who would never do any harm to anyone and willing to help anyone who needs it. My belief in myself is the only reason I am still here today and haven't gone through with ending my life. 

I believed that until last week. Last week, I received a message reminding me about something I did when I was 8 or 9 years old that has caused someone pain. Something unforgivable. I had forgotten all of these years. 

I keep telling myself that I am not that little kid. That a kid that age has no idea of the impact one's actions can have, and couldn't possibly understand the severity of what he did. I truly believe that, and I know that I am not that kid anymore. I tell myself that I am a good person, and I could never do those things. But this depression has taken a hold of me again. Now I can't stop thinking that I'm the worst person for ever having it in me to be able to do something like that. I don't know if I can live with myself knowing that I did what I did. There are moments of clarity and reasoning, but mostly I keep thinking of how to end this. I can't do it anymore, I need out. I have a girlfriend that I know I can't say this to, because I'm afraid of her leaving. And the only solution seems like just ending it myself. I'm this close to just doing it and ridding the world of that 9 year old boy. Please help me, because I can't help myself.

14326,"I can't keep putting it offSince starting school this is my third major instance where I've felt like killing myself. I've had the thought in the back of my mind of course, but there have been three where I genuinely feel like I'm going to do it. 

Each time I've talked myself out of it. In previous throwaways people have been no help. Last time I was here someone told me my excuses sounded pathetic and asked if I was here to vent before I off myself or if I even wanted help.

So in real life I've framed the question to family members as dropping out of school, not killing myself, and applied their advice there.

They told me ""Push through to another semester, see how it goes"". Then when things didn't get better they said ""Transfer to a new school, I bet things will look up""

But it hasn't. I'm in a shit situation where I don't qualify for financial aid anymore because I failed a class (the last time I wanted to die) and am paying 100% out of pocket for school.

Now I just spoke with my calculus professor who told me to drop my class. This will make it nearly impossible to ever get my financial aid back. I've already been fighting since December for it, and now this happens and it pretty much means I'll never get off suspension.

I don't have the money to pay for school, but everything I want in life hinges around getting a degree.

Before you say it, because I swear to god I'd rather kill myself than hear this, I'm not going to start my own business. That doesn't fucking work, don't even suggest it. I come from a family of businessmen, college is the best way to achieve that. Period. The whole ""You start from the bottom and work your way up!"" is such a fucking rare story that reddit loves. It doesn't. Fucking. Work. And it won't work for me. 

I also already tried trade school. I graduated from it. I sucked dick at it. That's why I'm here. So that won't work either.

Can't change majors either. Without financial aid then losing credits becomes real fucking expensive. I'm already pursuing the thing I thought I was best suited for anyways, I wouldn't even know what else I would pursue.

Tell me, why should I even bother continuing on? The one thing I want is becoming increasingly impossible. I have the means to kill myself and it'd be over in a flash. No more worrying about this, no more nightmares, no more sleepless nights, no more getting sick all the time. 

Tell me why I should put it off again. I'm willing to bet you're going to feed me the same bullshit everyone else does because you don't know what to tell me.

8441,"Not meant for this worldI've been coming to the conclusion that I was simply not made for this world. I am irrationally empathetic, especially with those closest to me. I have a nature of literally only taking care of others and not myself, and I get severely disgusted whenever I do nice things for myself. Sometimes I'll go days on end of not eating or drinking- simply bent on the thought of my desire to help and care for others. My body can't take it anymore.

Shit hit the fan pretty bad for me when the virus started to break out across the US. I was forced to move from the first place I had truly called home- college. It was my first year there, away from an abusive and neglecting family that had abandoned me once before. People genuinely cared for me at the college I was at, and I felt a sense of well-being that I had never before experienced in my life. The virus ripped me out of my dorm and sent me back home to an older brother and father that are constantly on edge, ready to explode. 

The last and only thing I could put my hope in were my grandparents. My grandma is the most loving and caring person I have ever met and she is easily my closest friend. My grandpa always provided me the greatest advice and support. One week back at home, continuing the spring semester online, I got news that my grandpa was hospitalized for a severe and complicated medical condition. To add on, my grandma's knees gave out and she too was hospitalized for a close-to-death heart attack. I immediately went over to be with them in the hospital and I would go on to take care of them back at their home for the rest of the semester. It was by far the most stressful time of my life. Having to stay on top of schoolwork, provide consistent care for my grandparents, and manage my own health (heart and mental issues) was extremely difficult. But I was more than willing to do anything for my grandparents because of all that they had done for me.

After a tragic fall and a brutal season of hospice, my grandpa passed. At that point, I couldn't take it any more. I promised myself 7 years ago that the pain I felt after my other grandpa passed, I was not going to go through it again. I was going to do whatever it took to not have to bear with another loved ones death. And so here I am now. I was not strong enough to care for my grandpa, and I failed him. I failed my grandma for not being the kind of support that she needed. I don't deserve the right to live because of my faults. I've just been so numb ever since he passed that I completely have no idea what to do.",suicide,"not meant for this worldi ve been coming to the conclusion that i was simply not made for this world i am irrationally empathetic, especially with those closest to me i have a nature of literally only taking care of others and not myself, and i get severely disgusted whenever i do nice things for myself sometimes i ll go days on end of not eating or drinking simply bent on the thought of my desire to help and care for others my body can t take it anymore  shit hit the fan pretty bad for me when the virus started to break out across the us i was forced to move from the first place i had truly called home college it was my first year there, away from an abusive and neglecting family that had abandoned me once before people genuinely cared for me at the college i was at, and i felt a sense of well being that i had never before experienced in my life the virus ripped me out of my dorm and sent me back home to an older brother and father that are constantly on edge, ready to explode  the last and only thing i could put my hope in were my grandparents my grandma is the most loving and caring person i have ever met and she is easily my closest friend my grandpa always provided me the greatest advice and support one week back at home, continuing the spring semester online, i got news that my grandpa was hospitalized for a severe and complicated medical condition to add on, my grandma s knees gave out and she too was hospitalized for a close to death heart attack i immediately went over to be with them in the hospital and i would go on to take care of them back at their home for the rest of the semester it was by far the most stressful time of my life having to stay on top of schoolwork, provide consistent care for my grandparents, and manage my own health heart and mental issues was extremely difficult but i was more than willing to do anything for my grandparents because of all that they had done for me  after a tragic fall and a brutal season of hospice, my grandpa passed at that point, i couldn t take it any more i promised myself 7 years ago that the pain i felt after my other grandpa passed, i was not going to go through it again i was going to do whatever it took to not have to bear with another loved ones death and so here i am now i was not strong enough to care for my grandpa, and i failed him i failed my grandma for not being the kind of support that she needed i don t deserve the right to live because of my faults i ve just been so numb ever since he passed that i completely have no idea what to do ",505
835,"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.

Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.

Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).

He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""

I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.

Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.

I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.

I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 

I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.

I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

I'll only tell you some basic facts about me, only because you don't need my life story. I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if I make any typing or grammar mistakes:

First off, as I just mentioned, I'm drunk. This is an issue because I'm underage, in fact I'm not even an adult. It isn't that I'm going out to parties to get drunk, in fact it's the opposite. The people who are supposed to love me the most and protect me are my enablers, my parents, who have drank before and after my birth for as long as I have been able to remember. I'm the last child, the youngest, so I am a victim and a product of dealing with my parents who are at the age of where they don't give a fuck anymore. My dad is a reserved, quiet, nice man. He brings home the bread and that keeps him happy, aside from his booze. My mother is the polar opposite, jobless, a ""stay-at-home"" mom, suffering from a disease that makes her head feel like she's been spun around in a tornado and then let go. She's loud, gets angry easily, and makes my life more miserable than I'd like. She's also one of the most emotional and passionate people I've ever met and I love her. She's lost a son before and that's been one of the reasons I haven't offed myself yet.

Tonight, we had our weekend tradition. Get drunk, play games, listen to music, chill, and talk. During the play games session (I get very upset over games, I got my short temper from my mother) I got angry at my mother for how she was playing the game, she started to yell at me, I threw my cards at her, almost broke my bottle from slamming it, and retreated to my computer. No one has spoken to me since. 

Since they are asleep, I began going through the medicine cabinet and I began looking at medicine in there. Googling the overdose effects and seeing how long it would take to kill me. Nothing I found interested me, most of them would kill me in 70+ hours after tons of pain and suffering, which isn't what I want. Hanging myself seems too awful, every time I think of it I picture the screams of whoever finds me, and I don't want to do that to someone. There's no working guns in my house, so that's out of the option. 

I don't know anymore, I just actively looked for ways to kill myself. If I found something proper, I probably would've done it.

Most recently I ruined my previous relationship because of how much I hate myself, my S/O at the time knew this because it was the only thing I'd talk about. why? I couldn't fucking tell you.

At this point, I'm terrified if I get the virus, not because I'm afraid to die because I'd never be able to show my face anywhere without being horrified people think I'm still sick and contagious. I've beaten pneumonia 6 times so the pneumonia tied to Corona doesn't scare me. I know I need help, I know I should go to a hospital. but why? so they can shove more pills down my throat that might leave me hanging from the showerhead with my fucking sheets? last time I went to a hospital they fed me Klonapin like it was fucking candy so I got hooked hard. I still love my last S/O, and they seemed to care at first, now they treat me like garbage even after telling me they'd be there for me, they said if I could learn to love myself they'd take me back.

9790,"A man in a white SUV flipped me offA little explanation. I've gotten into fights before while driving and it feels like shit for a while but I end up getting over it. This time I didnt flight. This man just flipped me off in his huge white SUV and I could do nothing. He proceeded to drive slowly in front of me to piss me off even more. 
I was hoping we stayed in the same apartment complex so somehow I could finally get out of the car and give him a piece of my mind too. He didnt. 

But I broke down crying in the elevator and then came home and sat on the floor crying. I dont know why at this point I could hear my parents speaking in the other room.

Me and my father dont really talk. The final straw for me was a month ago he was violent with me and since then we havent spoken. I want to move out but my mother (who is the only earning member of the family) lost her job. 
I have to say, my mom dosent particularly care for him either. I've always grown up with him screaming his lungs out to her. 

I then realised the man in the white SUV reminded me of my father (he also drives literally the same car and is also just an al around asshole, including the road. He is the kind of person who will flip someone off and then get even more satisfaction out of pissing them off further). That feeling of helplessness was something so familiar for me. Who am I in front of a big, powerful man who could hurt me in one blow if he wanted? 

I started screaming at my mom (lashing out in general) and ended up hitting her in the process. Pretty badly. I always tell her I want to move away from him and she says we will later. 

I ended up tearing my top off into pieces in frustration and went to look for the blade in my room, while my mom layed on the floor.
I hate the kind of person I've become. I dont want to be violent. I dont want to have a bad temper. I dont want to cry in bed. After around a month it's the first time I've felt suicidal again. After around 3 months it's the first time I cut myself again. I've never cut around my wrist but this time idk why I felt like trying. I dont want to live here. I've tried. A lot. I've tried and tried and tried with life. It just fucking dosent get better. Everytime I think I've hit rock bottom, theres always worse. Eveytime I think I'm getting better, it goes away. Therapy didnt work. I also called my two closest friends and neither came for me. I'm fucking tired. 

I dont want to be like this.",suicide,"a man in a white suv flipped me offa little explanation i ve gotten into fights before while driving and it feels like shit for a while but i end up getting over it this time i didnt flight this man just flipped me off in his huge white suv and i could do nothing he proceeded to drive slowly in front of me to piss me off even more  i was hoping we stayed in the same apartment complex so somehow i could finally get out of the car and give him a piece of my mind too he didnt  but i broke down crying in the elevator and then came home and sat on the floor crying i dont know why at this point i could hear my parents speaking in the other room  me and my father dont really talk the final straw for me was a month ago he was violent with me and since then we havent spoken i want to move out but my mother who is the only earning member of the family lost her job  i have to say, my mom dosent particularly care for him either i ve always grown up with him screaming his lungs out to her  i then realised the man in the white suv reminded me of my father he also drives literally the same car and is also just an al around asshole, including the road he is the kind of person who will flip someone off and then get even more satisfaction out of pissing them off further  that feeling of helplessness was something so familiar for me who am i in front of a big, powerful man who could hurt me in one blow if he wanted?  i started screaming at my mom lashing out in general and ended up hitting her in the process pretty badly i always tell her i want to move away from him and she says we will later  i ended up tearing my top off into pieces in frustration and went to look for the blade in my room, while my mom layed on the floor i hate the kind of person i ve become i dont want to be violent i dont want to have a bad temper i dont want to cry in bed after around a month it s the first time i ve felt suicidal again after around 3 months it s the first time i cut myself again i ve never cut around my wrist but this time idk why i felt like trying i dont want to live here i ve tried a lot i ve tried and tried and tried with life it just fucking dosent get better everytime i think i ve hit rock bottom, theres always worse eveytime i think i m getting better, it goes away therapy didnt work i also called my two closest friends and neither came for me i m fucking tired  i dont want to be like this ",504
12849,"I got into a fender bender today For those that dont know, a fender bender is a car crash which results in damage greater than a nick or scratch, and always has damaged body panels (pretty self explanatory)

 I got hit from behind while I was at a yeild trying to merge into the flow of traffic. Somehow the old lady who ran into me didn't know I was there and tried to force herself into the flow of traffic, but I was in the way. Fortunately, I was working at the time and was driving around a company van, so I don't have to worry about repairing my personal car. The impact was at pretty low speed, I was stopped and she was doing probably under 20km/h (~13mph?) so no one was seriously hurt. The intersection that I got hit is a really badly designed intercession with big blindspots and lots of fast moving traffic, so it wouldn't be uncommon for me to see an accident there once every couple weeks

I drive around my home city delivering auto parts for a living, so it was more a matter of when rather than if. Still, this was my first car accident (either driver or passenger). Scared the living shit out of me. The van I was driving is fine, it just needs a new bumper and a couple of new back doors. The check engine light didn't even come on. If I could properly latch the back doors I couldve kept driving it around and couldn't care less. Her SUV was a little more beat up though, as it looks like itll need a new bumper, rad, oil cooler, a/c condensor, etc. She actually took the plastic facia of my back bumper off and it was stuck in her grill when I got out to look. 

I'm glad that she didn't get hurt, she was probably 70ish years old. She was the first thing I checked on after I made sure that we were both parked off to the side of the road. A young man like me can heal, but someone her age would take a bit of effort to recover. 

No witnesses decided to stop and help. I guess they couldn't be bothered. It's a shame but unfortunately not uncommon in my city. 

For the first couple of hours after the accident my adrenaline was running really high (I could barely write down the other drivers info my hands were shaking so bad) so I didn't really feel anything but it's been about 9 hours since the accident and now my lower to mid back has really stiffened up and is giving me some grief. Don't worry though, I've already booked an appointment with my family doctor for tomorrow to see if any real damage has decided to show up.

1140,"Okay bois, so I need to know if a plan of mine will work So, where do I begin? (From the begining, I know) but, It's kinda a long story, so I will try to make it as short as possible.

So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know ¨I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too young¨ (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.

A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 

And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",non-suicide,"okay bois, so i need to know if a plan of mine will work so, where do i begin? from the begining, i know but, it s kinda a long story, so i will try to make it as short as possible  so, a little while after my ex broke up with me early september i belive i went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who i fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some 18 stuff, and then, my mom who is kinda a little bot too much religious saw one of those conversations about 18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse you know i shouldn t be thining that kind of stuff beacuse i am too young altho my ex friends used to talk about 18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once also, i wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in minecraft i know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn t any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3 00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, buti know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls  a few weeks passed after that and i couldn t do anything, and i found an old phone that i had, so i installed messenger to it and went with her, why? beacuse i love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that i do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that i was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about 18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that i cannot take, they didn t even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body i had low self steem and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when i try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager  and here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that i will go to theraphy later this month, so, i know that they won t listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, i will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it s cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",502
7850,"I am afraid.I am transgender (FTM) and in the closet; A glass closet. A few times I have tried to come out, but in a sarcastic tone, because I was afraid. All my friends laughed, and thought it was hilarious. At this point it is just so blatantly obvious that it hurts. I don’t how they can’t see it. I think it may be my fault. For years I have denied it adamantly: pretended to be upset when someone perceived me as male, spent hours reinforcing their view of me as a hardcore conservative Christian. Now that I am no longer in denial, I feel like I have dug myself into an inescapable hole.

I keep trying to come out to my closest friends for real. I have had the text message saved as a draft in my phone for months. When I go to send it, I remember all of the reasons why I shouldn't tell someone. Many of them have expressed anti-transgender sentiments, and purposely used wrong pronouns. Coming out to my parents at the moment is not an option, as I am almost positive this will lead to disownment, but I will have to tell them eventually. I don’t know how I am going to get myself through college without their support. I fear that I will end up homeless, starving, and alone.

I feel so despaired. Holding all of this in is slowly killing me. I don’t think I can take 3 more years of this. 

Every time I consider killing myself, there are always a few things that stop me; some files on my computer I would prefer no one ever see, or secrets I've been meaning to tell someone. I go to delete the files, or send the text message, and then I think “If I don’t do it, then I will still want these files/ not be able to face this person again.” For the most part, these things are the only reason I’m still alive. I’m afraid that one day, I will actually delete the files, spill my secrets, and have nothing holding me back.

I keep thinking about this kid that committed suicide last year at my school. I had never met him, or even heard of him before. Everyone was talking about him for a week; they were all suddenly his best friend.  After that, it was like he never existed. I keep thinking, what if I actually do it. Will all of the people who have terrorized me be saying “*She* was so talented” “I will really miss *her*”.

And it’s also Christmas. I have to see the family that will soon cease to love me, interact with friends that I will probably never see again after a certain point, and experience the holiday that I will one day be spending alone…

…Unless I kill myself that is…

 I am afraid.

TLDR; They say it gets better, but I just really don’t think it will for me.

14548,"I hope I don’t wake up tomorrowAfter several recent failed attempts to end my life by hanging myself, I finally bit the bullet and decided to instead take my life by taking all my prescription meds at once. 

There’s a good chance that, even at this dosage, it won’t be enough, but at least I can have some relief. Tonight, instead of lulling myself to sleep with made up stories of how I’m going to die in a terrible accident the next day, I am, for the first time in months, happy, because it is no longer a made up story. 

There is a chance, a small chance, of course, but it’s still there, that I will actually find the peace that I’ve been longing for. 

I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder (which I’m sure many of the posters here share). I was diagnosed a few months ago, when I became cognizant of the voice in my head that pushed me to end my life. Whether it was telling me to jump in front of the subway as it was pulling up to my station, to run into oncoming traffic, or to jump out the window, it would always chime in the second it found a scenario that ended with me dying. 

Fast forward from May to today, and intense therapy, many medications ranging from SSRIs  and SNRIs, to Lithium and bi-weekly blood tests, I’m exhausted. My mental health has only continued to deteriorate at a pace that I have no semblance of control over. And to tell you the truth, I no longer care. The same worry that brought me to my Therapist in May has been eroded, as has any hope of containing my mental decline. 

I no longer enjoy the things that, just a few months ago, brought me joy. I have isolated myself from all my friends, avoided making new ones, and drifted away from my family. I so desperately seek something to give me a reason to live, but I just can’t justify it anymore.

You know the truly sad part? I have no reason to be like this. In the past year, I lost over 100 pounds while hitting the gym. I have kept a 4.0 GPA and am ready to head into law school. I have a family who know of my struggles and refuse to let me drop them. 

But none of that matters to me. I will never look good enough, I will never be smart enough, I will never be popular enough. 

I will never be good enough for me.

So, as my eyes are now physically starting to close due to my full supply of hardcore sleeping meds, I have been left with only one choice, one last hope to appease myself. I am going to bed genuinely happy, as I know that this time, there’s a solid chance that I will not have to repeat my regular cycle.

14831,"i have no clue of what to do basically, there is this girl in my science class that I think is pretty cool, I have pretty much never talked to her, and I want to kind of be at least friends with her, the problem is that I have no idea of what to do, the only class and place I see her is in my science class where people sit in tables of 2, she sits with another guy that she talks to quite a lot, and she is constantly texting on discord for some reason, i believe she has a a boyfriend or something but I'm not sure, so I guess a more deep relationship would be a no go?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to figure out how to talk to her, but I cant agree with any of my ideas for one reason or another, my first idea was to sort of try to put a note on her table with my discord or something to see if we could chat, but since we sit in tables of 2, the other person would see that and it just would be awkward, also I sit with another person (i sit in the table right behind her so that's why i got that idea).

I have thought about just talking to her but outside of science class I can't find a way to do so, there are barely any chances for me to talk to her in that class, and there is no other place I have seen her, I can't even try sitting close to her during lunch because we have assigned seats because of covid, and I don't sit anywhere near her.

These are the best ones I can think of right now, and even if there was an opportunity for one of those, I would be extremely shy to do so for a number of reasons that include: English not being my first language (I can speak it well, but I get bumped pretty often), my voice kind of adds up to that, also my appearance a bit, but the most significant one being that I was in a filming class with her last year, and last year I was pretty much one those people who only speak in meme language (I too hate myself for that), there was also a very cringe video I was on that I made with some friends, which I looked like a complete idiot, there is a pretty high chance that she still has that memory, so it will make things weird to be honest.

And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when I’m scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because I’m too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts I’d got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know it’s basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just can’t help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesn’t matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I don’t feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits weren’t enough and I feel like I’m just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From ‘soulmate’ to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like I’m too sensitive for a man, and that I’m not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. I’m 31 but I feel like I’ve been struggling for so long.",suicide,"ideation ended up in making a noose tonight or trying too or experimenting with putting the belt around the shower rail even though i had no real intention of killing myself, i did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped id slip and accidentally end up hanging myself  i feel like im too sensitive for this world and that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, i care about people too much, i get attached and when im scared to lose them i end up pushing them away because im too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend a month ago she was telling me how thoughtful i was due to the gifts id got her now, she wants nothing to do with me and i know its basically because i sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship  this has been a pattern for me  i develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it  with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague i try and rein it in but i just cant help it with this lady, i genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking i was her work husband she is single  when this happens i feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and i end up losing all that, so it doesnt matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought i was, in the end i just ruin it  i dont feel i have anything to offer because the positive traits werent enough and i feel like im just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me my ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back from soulmate to dumping me after 10 days together where i pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home i had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money  i feel like im too sensitive for a man, and that im not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive i am and that i just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave  and i really am just tired of it now im 31 but i feel like ive been struggling for so long ",498

Anyway, since the teachers can't handle so many students, they let a website known as apex do most of the teaching for them. You see, I am a failure when it comes to just about anything, my only skill is art but that is a path I don't intend to pursue in life.

3207,"I simply cannot restartHello complete fucking strangers. I usually am on the other end of these things begging strangers to change theit habits meditate, read some books, stop thinking negatively, pick up an instrument, exercise, ect ect... Today is different though, I have found a problem for which there is no contingency. 

I have been depressed for years, since I was 10 years old. I was a isolated angry child. In high school I was an akward pariah with a bad reputation. Through out most of my childhood I have been bullied or been involved in horrible one sided relationships. Toward the end of junior year things started to turn around for me. I was making real friendships, and I had a social life.

About a year ago my most recent bought of anxiety and depression started. My main group of friends blew up when an argument between me and a friend horribly escalated. Nobody really talks anymore and it made me look pretty terrible to say the least. Soon after that I noticed one of my oldest friends was sociopathic. He lied to me on multiple occasions, wether it be telling me the girl I was talking to was a lesbian or when he snitched another friend out ruining his life to keep himself out of trouble. When I confided in him he would use it as ammunition in later arguments. ""This is why everyone hates you"", he knew how paranoid I was about that type of shit. One day he was on Xanax driving stuffing his face with McDonald's. I pleaded with him to pay attention but they were met with insults. He almost wreaked, and after that I kicked him out of my life. He than told everyone I was unstable, and since I stayed bitter while he cleaned up his act. He stopped pissing everyone off and dug in his heels while I tried to convince a few other something was wrong. ""That's just how he is, he's just a dick sometimes"", needless to say I lost to his manipulation. I can see on Instagram and snapchat how much fun they have without me. I don't really have my friends from high school between these two incidents my reputation has been severely damaged. Now at work I am getting a reputation for being a weirdo. It's getting harder and harder to communicate with others, and I can hear the part-timers in particular openly talking shit. 

My brother and I were discussing how bad things have gotten. He tells me my only option is to restart find completely new friends and a new job. It's that or be ignored by everyone who I thought was my friend and be stuck in a workplace that's beginning to feel a lot like high school.

11151,"MelancholicI've been working the same job for a year. For a year I've been sexually harassed on multiple occasions. Whether it be people pulling my hair and telling me my handle is tight today, or ""you lookin for me baby"" as I walk by my coworkers. I am belittled and roadblocked from doing my job constantly by people who are not in my department. I have been told to smile because it makes me look prettier on days where all I want is to hurt myself.
I have no desire to self harm because ultimately the pain doesn't distract me. It compounds and makes my depression much worse. Every relationship I've had in my life has become sour eventually. That is all I'm used to. I am currently with someone I don't feel I deserve, my friends of years gnore me and post insensitive things online about how when you complain it does nothing, so you shouldn't. I have nobody to talk to who really cares or truly hopes to see me progress. I am constantly depressed or on edge. I have a place with my boyfriend and an ex army room mate who screamed in my face whilst I was  unknowingly pregnant. I miscarried later, which made me call out of work for two days as I passed my child. I was written up for calling out of work, though I know people with worse attendance. The person who wrote me up doesn't work at the same facility but in an office off property. I was forced to disclose my miscarriage to a stranger. I have never felt more worthless and since then I haven't gotten back to where or who I was. I have lost enjoyment in most things and every day I have these passive thoughts of jumping from the roof of my work, or stepping in front of a bus. I am aggressive to people I care about and I'm easily annoyed and I can't control it. I just want to live in a world where grown men conduct themselves better than I do, a 22 year old woman. I hate the idea of waking up, I hate going to sleep. I hate eating, I hate money, I hate living this way. Nothing seems to work for me, I think it's time I found a solution. Logically to me, the only option is to end it considering I've always been treated this way, through school, at my jobs, in my family and relationships, I just always manage to fuck up or end up unhappy. I want to end my life so the struggling ends. I want to feel nothing versus continual shame and disappointment in myself and everyone around me.

14387,"I think this might be last thing I typeI was born in extreme poverty. How extreme? At point of time , My father and his siblings had to gather wheat grains fallen while transporting them for food. But when I was born , my father was working hard to give me two times a day food with help of my mother.

Growing up I was a unruly boy. I was all over place. Screaming &amp; attacking etc doing all crazy sort of things. Because of lack of education, my parents didn't knew any better nor they could afford any of my medical expenses. Since they thought I was just being general asshole , they started punishing me physically. My mother has put powdered chilly in my eyes and throat countless times this continued until 13 . On other side,  my school started to get more shitty , As there were lots of bullies that bullied me. At age of 15 , I tried to commit suicide, I tried to jump off of my school building. Also what contributed is death of paternal grandparents , my maternal grandfather and my paternal uncle. They were really close to me, and until that point they were the only people that  gave me nice things like toys , A $1 toy was fortune for me.

Later, well into adulthood, I found out that I have ADHD , and because of my past, I have sever depression, anxiety &amp; PTSD.

But My father and mother worked hard none the less and put me and my younger brother through engineering college ( I took 10 years for 4 years school). Now I work as engineer, and because all of mental issues, I have no one.But I had friend tho , she went through bad child hood experience has child hood as I did. She lives half way across the world. I used to talk to her daily. But she is now busy in school and word and don't have time to talk to me.

Now , I am 30 . I   have no friends , I live in decent house but no one is here except me . I have no one that loves me anymore . I don't talk to anyone. I go to work 9 come back at 6, and that is it. I have no one who loves me anymore , no one. And because of my anxiety I can't get into dating scene 

I have long thought about this over several times , I keep asking myself a question what I have to give to this world. I have nothing, Nothing.

So Yesterday , I got some potassium cyanide from work. I might try to off myself in couple of days. I have taken sick leave for couple of days . I might take it some point in couple of days.

That's not life, that's a fucking sentence. A God damn prison sentence. And at a fucking place like MY work? Dear USPS, I understand now, why people ""go Postal"". You drive me so fucking hard, for me to only barely be able to pay bills. FUCK. YOU. 

&gt;#2   Mom, I wish you would've just put me up for adoption, not keep me because someone told you they didn't think you could make it with me at your age. All you've done is make everything about yourself while never considering other people's feelings. And made countless shitty fucking decisions, and your just an ass hole.

&gt;#3 Dad, why'd you have to be worthless? I know your parents didn't teach you very well how to be  a parent or husband, but Jesus, you could've been there, made better money decisions, actually put some food on the table instead of me and Mom starving all the time. Maybe just have been a father. It's so hard watching the kids now, get a dad I never had.

&gt;#4  Lauren, I miss you so much. I loved you, and I still do. If you walked through the door, I'd scoop you up in my arms and ask you to start over. I'm sorry I didn't know how to be the man you needed, or how to be a man at all. I wish I would've told you everything. You were so open with me, and I was a fucking maze of unexpressed emotions and thoughts.

&gt;#5 Myself, why are you such a disappointment? Why don't you try harder? Why don't you stop being a fucking pushover? Why don't you just go for the things you've always wanted? Why didn't you reach out to her before it *was* too late and tell her everything you wished you would've? Why are you always scared, scared of setting an expectation, of putting yourself out there, of starting over? I hate you. The reason we've always had it hard was because you weren't a fucking man. Because you weren't good enough. If only I could separate myself from you, everything would be different. 

&gt;#5. God, are you there? Life doesn't make sense without a beginning and in my eyes, that was you, but where are you?

7307,"What should I do?I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but here goes. I'm not planning on committing suicide at the moment, but I really feel like it's inevitable. I bought a rope to hang myself with.

I guess my problems are these:

- I judge my self-worth based on my marks (I am a university student). When I do really poorly I feel awful. When I do well, I only feel like ""phew, I didn't screw up this time at least"".

- I'm really lonely. I know some people that I occasionally hang around, but I'm not really comfortable talking to them about anything or really doing things one-on-one. I just sort of hang around while there are other people there.

- That brings me to my lack of social skills. I can't talk about anything other than school or work, unless I awkwardly ask questions like ""so, seen any movies lately"" and get two sentence of back and forth. I don't really enjoy being around other people.

- I'm gay and haven't come out yet. I'm not worried that people would be homophobic if I came out. I'm worried about people bringing up times when people were talking about relationships or sex, and I either lied about past fake-relationships, or present possible relationships, or just said something like ""haven't met the right girl yet I guess haha!"". This sort of thing has happened before (with things other than homosexuality) when I lied in order to not have to talk about myself. The second thing I'm worried about (to do with this) is that people will ask me awkward, predictable questions about my gayness. I anticipate that these questions will be really annoying.

- I don't think I'm very likeable. As in, I think I'm physically unattractive (my nose is tilted one direction on my face, the back of my neck always gets hairy, my clothes don't fit me, my legs are skinny) and also I don't think people would like my personality if they got to know me. I get stressed really easily and don't like sports, tv, or much of whatever other people might like. This ties in to the lack of social skills too I guess.

- I don't have anything about my future that I expect will make me happy, anything that I'm looking forward to.

Sorry for rambling. What I want in some sort of self-help method so I can like myself and like other people.  I want to know how to be happy. Preferably there would be scientific evidence that the method works. (There's therapy too I guess, but I've tried it and it wasn't very helpful. Just made me feel guilty about complaining. Yeah there are other types of therapy but I don't really want to do it.)",suicide,"what should i do?i m not sure if this is the right place to post, but here goes i m not planning on committing suicide at the moment, but i really feel like it s inevitable i bought a rope to hang myself with  i guess my problems are these   i judge my self worth based on my marks i am a university student  when i do really poorly i feel awful when i do well, i only feel like phew, i didn t screw up this time at least   i m really lonely i know some people that i occasionally hang around, but i m not really comfortable talking to them about anything or really doing things one on one i just sort of hang around while there are other people there   that brings me to my lack of social skills i can t talk about anything other than school or work, unless i awkwardly ask questions like so, seen any movies lately and get two sentence of back and forth i don t really enjoy being around other people   i m gay and haven t come out yet i m not worried that people would be homophobic if i came out i m worried about people bringing up times when people were talking about relationships or sex, and i either lied about past fake relationships, or present possible relationships, or just said something like haven t met the right girl yet i guess haha  this sort of thing has happened before with things other than homosexuality when i lied in order to not have to talk about myself the second thing i m worried about to do with this is that people will ask me awkward, predictable questions about my gayness i anticipate that these questions will be really annoying   i don t think i m very likeable as in, i think i m physically unattractive my nose is tilted one direction on my face, the back of my neck always gets hairy, my clothes don t fit me, my legs are skinny and also i don t think people would like my personality if they got to know me i get stressed really easily and don t like sports, tv, or much of whatever other people might like this ties in to the lack of social skills too i guess   i don t have anything about my future that i expect will make me happy, anything that i m looking forward to  sorry for rambling what i want in some sort of self help method so i can like myself and like other people  i want to know how to be happy preferably there would be scientific evidence that the method works  there s therapy too i guess, but i ve tried it and it wasn t very helpful just made me feel guilty about complaining yeah there are other types of therapy but i don t really want to do it ",495

For the past year and a half or so, I've been involved with a guild for the online roleplaying game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Most of the officers are a tight-knit group of people who knew each other from previous games. One in particular, I found out fairly early on, is a biological male who identifies as female, and has been planning to transition once they finish college.

In the past I've butted heads with this individual; she has often acted very snippy and angry towards members of the guild for minimal provocation. I always tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, however, since being a straight male who identifies as male, I can't imagine how emotionally tumultuous it could be to go through something like this. Still, I never noticed anything too serious.

Time went on, interest in the game waned, and most of the other original founders aside from this one individual quit, or disappeared for months without a word. Again, I didn't think much of it, until this one person started saying things along the lines of ""I may be dropping off the grid soon. Don't try to contact me if that happens.""

The other night, my girlfriend who also plays with us got in touch with her, and was told rather casually that they plan on killing themselves by the end of the month. This seems to have been an ongoing plan for a while, and they seem pretty determined. She talked to my girlfriend for several hours, about failed relationships, about feeling severe anger at the friends who left the game/disappeared without saying anything (things along the lines of ""they abandoned me, I want them to hurt them and make them miss me."") She indicated that she sees a doctor but that it apparently doesn't help, and they aren't interested in a hotline or anything of the sort.

I'm not sure how authentic this is or what the protocol is. I don't for sure know her real name or where they live. I'm not sure what I could possibly say to them that hasn't already been said. I've dealt with anxiety issues myself in the past, but suicide talk is a bit out of my comfort zone. I don't want to inadvertently make things worse, but if I don't do anything and they kill themselves, am I partially responsible?

So I ask, compassionate redditors, what would you do in this situation? Try to be their friend, even if they push you away? Call the police on them? Give them space?",suicide,"an online acquaintance of mine has threatened to commit suicide  is there anything i can/should do?first i d like to say that i love the community you have here, and am very proud that there are redditors willing to chat with and help folks even if they ve never met them before  for the past year and a half or so, i ve been involved with a guild for the online roleplaying game star wars the old republic most of the officers are a tight knit group of people who knew each other from previous games one in particular, i found out fairly early on, is a biological male who identifies as female, and has been planning to transition once they finish college  in the past i ve butted heads with this individual she has often acted very snippy and angry towards members of the guild for minimal provocation i always tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, however, since being a straight male who identifies as male, i can t imagine how emotionally tumultuous it could be to go through something like this still, i never noticed anything too serious  time went on, interest in the game waned, and most of the other original founders aside from this one individual quit, or disappeared for months without a word again, i didn t think much of it, until this one person started saying things along the lines of i may be dropping off the grid soon don t try to contact me if that happens  the other night, my girlfriend who also plays with us got in touch with her, and was told rather casually that they plan on killing themselves by the end of the month this seems to have been an ongoing plan for a while, and they seem pretty determined she talked to my girlfriend for several hours, about failed relationships, about feeling severe anger at the friends who left the game/disappeared without saying anything things along the lines of they abandoned me, i want them to hurt them and make them miss me  she indicated that she sees a doctor but that it apparently doesn t help, and they aren t interested in a hotline or anything of the sort  i m not sure how authentic this is or what the protocol is i don t for sure know her real name or where they live i m not sure what i could possibly say to them that hasn t already been said i ve dealt with anxiety issues myself in the past, but suicide talk is a bit out of my comfort zone i don t want to inadvertently make things worse, but if i don t do anything and they kill themselves, am i partially responsible? so i ask, compassionate redditors, what would you do in this situation? try to be their friend, even if they push you away? call the police on them? give them space?",495

I am incredibly bored and dissatisfied with my life. Im 16 and in a horrible place, mentally. Everytime I think about it, I make myself out to be an idiot, but I can't ignore the feeling anymore. 
On paper, I probably seem like a pretty decent person. B+ average in honors classes, cohead of a few clubs, very extroverted, amazing girlfriend, and from a relatively well-off family. Despite all of this, I manage to make myself feel worthless. I'm extremely hypercritical of myself, and I'm extremely paranoid as a result of never satisfying my parent's desire to be the absolute best. Every time my girlfriend does anything to suggest in the slightest that she isn't 'madly in love' with me, I feel insecure and want to break up. It's stupid, and I don't deserve her. After moving schools, I feel like my personality netted me a lot of friends, but not a single one can break the surface and talk about anything real. I feel like I'm becoming this fake person with a plastered-on smile. In complete honesty, I haven't genuinely laughed in 5 months, although it's a pretty common sight to see me chuckling with a group of people. I haven't contributed anything to anyone. I've just been sucking resources from my family, and done nothing to reciprocate at all. For someone who is depressed, I do believe I am extremely rational. That's the only thing keeping me from killing myself. It's knowing that people might be affected, and temporarily scarred that someone they were so 'close' to was actually considering shooting their brains out for months on end. My family life is dull. After leaving the numbskulls at school, I'm taken back to a household devoid of love and a feeling of anything. I hate being at home. I hate being at school. I hate associating myself with people who have never had a real conversation in their lives, and I hate how ignorant I'm becoming because of it. I hate that I'm jealous of my girlfriend, the sweetest, most intelligent, pure creature on this side of the world. I just hate the hole in my life, and that I'm not up to my own depressing expectations. I hate my faltering grip on school, and seeing my future pass me by. I simply hate myself. I'm literally bored to death and I hate every second of my existence. There's so much more to it that I'm listing, but it's over now, and there's no point crying over spilt milk.

First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 

Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 

I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 

I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 

I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music. I cant do both cause i feel u dont have enough time in a day. Im lost. Im sad. Im happy when i take drugs. Im happy when i drink. Im not a druggie or an alcoholic.  I just i feel nothing anymore.

I feel like I'm a disgrace, I failed in life, and my life isn't worth living. I'm a 30 years old female, and I used to have it all- I was a model, I had a fiance, I thought life is working out just fine for me. Then I stopped modeling to move to the country of my fiance (before we lived together in another country). Turns out he had been cheating on me with countless women. The last women he cheated with was a girl he fell for, and after I found out he has been cheated I left him, and he started dating her. The only man I ever fully trusted, gave my heart to, and loved to death lied and cheated to be and decided I'm not worth more than a piece of trash. Ever since, I have been trying to date and it always comes down to the same- I never feel anything for the guys that are into me, and every time I am into a guy he doesn't give a shit about me. 


Friends of mine of the same age are married with kids, while I still have the same life as ten years ago. I work, come home, watch Netflix and sleep. On the weekends I do drugs with friends because it's the only joy I have in life, the only way to escape my issues for a bit. People keep telling me with 30 I am over the hill, and that, if I ever want to find a husband and have a family, I should do it now, or else I'm a lost cause. Deep inside I know having a family is not in my cards, as much as I would love to have one. I would love to be in love, have children, but I just know this is never going to happen for me. 


Soon I'm going to be old, ugly and infertile and I will be full of regrets.The future scares me so much and gives me the worst anxiety. I can't imagine ten years from now, being 40 and alone, losing my beauty, still being in the exact same situation, probably even lonelier. Sometimes I see myself in the mirror and just want to take a big knife and ram it into my heart. I often hate myself. I often feel like I'm worth nothing. The only reason I don't kill myself is my wonderful parents, probably the only people that have ever truly loved me. I could never do that to them, as much as I would love to.

10287,"My problem literallt cannot be fixed. Long post..Hi, I've recently been browsing this sub reddit trying to give people some advice and help on their situation, yet whenever i do this and get off this sub reddit it makes me feel even shitter and worse about my ""problem"" i guess. 

On the 16th of July my girlfriend took her own life she was loved in so many ways but she had a terrible childhood which included physical abuse, alcoholic and drug obsessed parents as well as being abandoned and homeless for periods of times. This led her to believe that she was a burden to everyone and everything that was with her, that she would be better off dead because she was so clumsy and would critique herself over unimportant things. Thats why when i read these posts, im in no way taking away how bad your problems are but to me, they all seem ""managable or changable"" in a way. Especially the ones which say ""theyll be better off with me dead,"" those are the worst for me. Because i can guarantee you that is not true. Yet the only way to fix my problem is to bring her back to life. 

Im so tired of waking up everyday knowing she died believing all the wrong things. Im so tired of having to wake up knowing shes dead. Knowing she fucking killed herself believing that she was doing me a favour by ridding her of herself. No one knew she had depression and the ones that did, didnt speak out. Im just so tired waking up everyday and trying to be strong, trying to get better when all i want is to be with her and i have all wills and intentions to take my own life in an act to prove that she was wrong, that she didnt need to die in vain. However also to end my misery and sadness which seems to grow stronger by the second. 

So for all of the suicidal people out there, i guess all i can say is please please speak out to someone, give someone a chance to help you, give the people you love the chance they deserve to give you a hand. 

You may not think it but your predetermined idea of how you are, how youre a burden, how useless and trapped you are. I may be completely wrong, but just tell them how youre feeling, because at the end of the day if they still dont help, if they still dont change your mind or help you or anything helps you, you can still commit to suicide. Just explore all your options first. There are plenty. 

As for me, there is nothing that ""fix"" my problem.

If you have any questions on what it is like on your loved ones if you kill yourself, go ahead and ask. Ill do anything to try save a life",suicide,"my problem literallt cannot be fixed long post hi, i ve recently been browsing this sub reddit trying to give people some advice and help on their situation, yet whenever i do this and get off this sub reddit it makes me feel even shitter and worse about my problem i guess  on the 16th of july my girlfriend took her own life she was loved in so many ways but she had a terrible childhood which included physical abuse, alcoholic and drug obsessed parents as well as being abandoned and homeless for periods of times this led her to believe that she was a burden to everyone and everything that was with her, that she would be better off dead because she was so clumsy and would critique herself over unimportant things thats why when i read these posts, im in no way taking away how bad your problems are but to me, they all seem managable or changable in a way especially the ones which say theyll be better off with me dead, those are the worst for me because i can guarantee you that is not true yet the only way to fix my problem is to bring her back to life  im so tired of waking up everyday knowing she died believing all the wrong things im so tired of having to wake up knowing shes dead knowing she fucking killed herself believing that she was doing me a favour by ridding her of herself no one knew she had depression and the ones that did, didnt speak out im just so tired waking up everyday and trying to be strong, trying to get better when all i want is to be with her and i have all wills and intentions to take my own life in an act to prove that she was wrong, that she didnt need to die in vain however also to end my misery and sadness which seems to grow stronger by the second  so for all of the suicidal people out there, i guess all i can say is please please speak out to someone, give someone a chance to help you, give the people you love the chance they deserve to give you a hand  you may not think it but your predetermined idea of how you are, how youre a burden, how useless and trapped you are i may be completely wrong, but just tell them how youre feeling, because at the end of the day if they still dont help, if they still dont change your mind or help you or anything helps you, you can still commit to suicide just explore all your options first there are plenty  as for me, there is nothing that fix my problem  if you have any questions on what it is like on your loved ones if you kill yourself, go ahead and ask ill do anything to try save a life",492
33,"Posting Galadriel’s opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

10765,"Someone is trying to kill me.. Me.I am in a very disturbing place in my life, im 34 and have suffered from PTSD, anxiety, depression, and alcoholism/addiction pretty much since sexual trauma when I was 12. 

I dont want to feel like I want to die all the time anymore, to the point that I want to die. 

I am medicated, I have played guinea pig for my doctors for too long. I take an SSRI and some benzos when my doc is nice enough to prescribe them. I have tried too many brain altering chemicals and Im finished punishing my body to find that one that ""works"". All in all, I honestly dont feel SSRIs, SNRIS etc etc have done me any good. Studies show they are no more effective than placebo. And having used so many combinations I am inclined to believe that sentiment. 

Yes I have had suicidal ideation since the ripe age of 12, but never as much as on anti-D's. But I continue to take them.

I dont really know where to start. I am looking forward to seeing my therapist in 4 hours.

Bottom line, I am doing the things people suggest to recover. But still want the pain to end. I stay away from alcohol, cuz its the most dangerous psychotropic drug on this planet IMO. I see my doc at least once or twice a month and regularly take my meds as prescribed. Here are the major stressors in my life currently.

-excessive absenteeism at work (all my FMLA claims are being denied, they dont see paralyzing anxiety as something serious) so im about to lose my job.

-loneliness, my partner of 16 years left me last year and got remarried, grief, pain, jealousy... I attempted sucide twice over this in the past year. Feeling better about this sitch but will always be there.

-legal issues.. facing a potential dui, spent christmas eve in a jail cell. automatic suspension for refusing a blood sample. ( I am very confident I was under the .08 limit but who knows)

-isolation. fucking killer..

Yes things do get better sometimes, but the reward to pain ratio is not worth hanging on through the bad times, they say it will get better.. heres the ugly truth. it does, but my mental illness will come back to kick me in the ass always. ALWAYS.

IDK why i am even bothering with this.. I will get the usual ""things get better"" 

The best thing that can ever happen to me would be to have a terminal illness.  I could make peace with my God, people would treat me with compassion, who calls a cancer patient ""lazy"", I could die without the trauma that suicide causes to my loved ones.

15650,"I Just Want To Fucking DieI don't know where else to pour my feelings out that I have right now. I can't go to Facebook without people calling the police and getting me admitted to a psych ward so I figured I would just type as I cry my eyes out.

I am fucking miserable. I'm a failure. Nobody loves me. It just feels like people tolerate me so they won't feel guilty when I finally build up the courage to end it. I want to die so badly. The only thing that stops me is I'm a giant pussy and I'm afraid of what would happen if I survived.

I've been horribly depressed for over a year, going on two, and nothing I do seems to help. I've tried therapy, I've tried tons of different meds, but nothing seems to help. I can't get out of my own head that I am a failure and I am unlovable.

It was my dream to become a police officer. I wanted to do it so badly. I started doing dispatch here in SLC and loved it. Eventually I got my chance and was hired by a police department that paid for all my training. I got out of the academy and started my training and I quit within a month because I was so miserable. But even though I quit because I didn't like it, I still feel like a complete and total failure. Ever since I quit my life has gone to shit. I had to go back to dispatch, a job I hate, with my tail between my legs while the rumor mill started. I was in a relationship at the time and she ended it to be with someone else (a cop who also ended up treating her like shit, long story that doesn't matter right now). 

I just feel like I'm doomed to a life of inadequacy and a life of loneliness because I'm too depressing to be around. I'm 23, I live in my mom's basement, I'm a virgin who's only ever had one serious girlfriend, and I can't even keep a fucking job. I don't see what the point is anymore. Why should I keep going when I know my life isn't going to get any better? I'm so unhappy all the time and I wish I had the fucking courage to kill myself. I came really close a few months ago and I wish I had done it then.

I'm not looking for help or for someone to try and give me reasons to live. I just needed to vent a bit. As I've typed this I think it might be beneficial to call a crisis line to try and get some emergency help.

2655,"Irreversible problemIn general I've had an alright life. I've got friends, I'm generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me, I have a supportive mother and family, I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm, fincally alright off and I had a loving, caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with, as did she.

Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life.

During our two year relationship she'd been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better.
The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times, but I stuck by her because she was worth it. 

Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I'd been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her. 

Since it happened everything has just spiralled. Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me. It's put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live. I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much.

The main thing above all else is how I've lost her and I can't fathom or face a life without her. She was just too special, too loving, too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her. I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would've happened had I just stayed.

I'm 32, I've spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity. It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted.

It's been over half a year since it happened and I'm just getting worse. Even with therapy, grief counselling, medication and endless research I'm not improving. I won't meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare. 

I don't really want to die but again, I can't face a reality without her. I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it, getting the confidence to do it. I get no joy from anything, I just cry and spend all day in bed. Not even sure why posting this, I guess it's just somewhere to vent.

4659,"I want to die, but am too scared of most methodsI often have thoughts of killing myself, and one of the few things that helps is looking at gore. It may be weird, but it sets my mind straight and helps me appreciate life. It also makes me fear most methods of suicide. But tonight, I've been struggling with an exam, and its the silliest reason, but it brought back all of my old thoughts and feelings. There is a lot in life to love, hobbies, SO's, family. But everything with me seems to fade away. 

My hobbies always change, and I can't stand the thought that history shows for me that in a few months I'll abandon my novel and move on to some other silly quest for success in a limitless field that is always just slightly too boring or difficult for my tastes. 

I've never had a girlfriend, I'm 22, never been kissed really, and day by day, my self-pity becomes self-loathing mixed with lies that I don't care anymore. I try to harden myself to what I am, someone who has had many chances to have a girlfriend or date a girl that liked me and that I liked as well. But those times were years ago, and now I am at a new school for just one semester before I graduate, and everyone has their own little clique and I just can't fit in. My friends are all moved away or stopped getting in touch with me. The only people I talk to is family really. I feel empty inside, and the only thing that keeps me sane is writing and reading, which as I already said, will probably cease to be a real hobby of mine in the near future.

I just can't stand living, right now. My cravings grow every second that I think about school or work or student loans. I want nothing more than to blow off this exam, buy some cough syrup and go to town on that shit. I don't even know why I like it. Last time I used it I drank 6 bottles, although I did throw up at the end, and blacked out for a few hours. It is literally just a way to make time disappear, and is not enjoyable in any way. It's just a habit that I've developed, with no real reason to it except I'm addicted. And the fact that I still get goosebumps from thinking about it kills me. I just want it all to be over with. I feel worthless and as if I am just another average person. I am a no name that will be lost in the pages of history as just another man that never did anything other than sit on my ass and read.

9346,"Six months later.Saw the community and wanted to make an account for it. First time on Reddit- but I thought it was a good idea to let this all off my chest. We'll see if the ale beats me to it tonight.

For context. I was dateless in Highschool. Graduated 2017. Now being 21 and my final semester of Trade school. I guess you can say I am proud of that. A lot happened between the two.  
- I reconnected with old gaming/texting buddies from Middle school / early Highschool. 
- I instantly fell in love with this girl who I thought was amazing. We would laugh at everything together. She reciprocated feelings. We started a relationship. 
- Blah blah lovey dovey. She was a state away. OP should try his best to make it all work. I enjoyed every minute I could get with her and my friend group. A good year later. (I know.. a long time right?) It slowly fell apart. She started hanging out with a friend who had a crush on her a 'long time ago'. Yeah. That's cool. But- she spent most of her days with him. Leaving me out there. 
I got terribly jealous (is that o.k.?) I guess I didn't express my feelings enough. But needless to say we took a break. Easy enough. Well , a week later she wanted to meet up like we initially planned. Sure. Anything to fix what we have.
I drive to her state. Half a day. Easy. 

4 hours into settling down at her place. She breaks up with me. Hahah. What? Speechless- away from home. Unaware of the city around me. What could I do? I picked a corner and sobbed away. She couldn't even face me. Until I could leave. Heart broken and Confused. I drive home. Friends and Family pick up on my depressive state. Work was hard. But I pushed through. 

I began to fail my classes. Caused me to pull a massive loan to retake em'

I'm exhausted, poor, drinking every night- hell I got a can in the hand... I'm wanting to leave all of this behind. This small town. This depressive state of being alone. 

Yes. I tried to re-date. Cute. Funny girl. She was being paid to be some neckbeards girlfriend. And chose to stay with him- money pays. I am stunned. I've been keeping my Handgun close to my head. The smallest of inconvenience kills me. Hell it's taken a major toll on my friends. I am not the happy Senior who would do anything. I work school drink sleep repeat. It never ends. And have been left behind to a dark, dank, cold room

This may be small and I can't really express everything in my head correctly? Thanks alcohol? Maybe it isn't.. I just don't know.

13401,"Dear HumanityIt’s funny how life works...it really is the roll of the dice. Some people live brilliant successful lives by climbing their way to the top. Some people live lives of heartache and pain...they then turn that into an art and become successful too. Some people are just ordinary and blessed with a family or maybe just a single parent and they thrive and overcome the odds. Some people are born with terminal illness, mental illness, disabilities, and whatever else and they all succeed. Then you got people like me...people who tried everything they could and fought their way with everything they had...only to not be enough. Now...here I am on this random reddit page venting this all out because I see no outcome other than death after this.

Make your significant other some food (breakfast, lunch and or dinner) whatever you feel like you can do...buy them flowers...take them on dates...make them smile and laugh, help them feel motivated like they can do anything. Most of all...let them know you will always be there. 

I was once so ignorant and arrogant that I thought I could help everyone. Because I hate it when people are hurt and I tried to make it my number one priority to help others in anyway that I could because I thought we needed more love in this world. I took on a responsibility that was impossible and I should have seen it coming...but alas I allowed my own ignorance and arrogance to blind me. That is my own fault and I take ownership for such foolishness. 

Now here I am recovering from a botched surgery that should have killed me and to be frank...I wish it did. When I finally got better and tried to start again with my monthly disability...natural disasters struck my hometown leaving many out of a home, car, everything. While I was lucky in that regard the day after the disasters happened my car was stolen...probably by someone who was desperate.

If you have klinefelter plus living in a western feminized society where people put their emotions over brutal honest rational logical thinking, then youre really fucked and i mean really fucked.

Ive tried to castrate myself serveral times (didnt worked), im at a point life where i just want to give up.

Im absolutely undesireable to the opposite sex, if you say something in our todays society, you get answers like ""there someone for everyone out there"".

most humans are to narcissistic to accept their trur nature, humans are actually nothing else than animals who walk on 2 feet, humans ARENT individuals, human behaviour is primitive and easy to classify in a big collective, we are not complex individual modern beings, funnywise most people doesnt even know that our dna code never changed since the beginning of mankind. 

Our society is basically nothing else than a big hypocrisy...

It is senseless to live as a klinefelter male, you will only experience frustration through being selected out by men and especially women. 

A ugly non-masculine man is getting called a perv, often alone for only having frontal baldness, while a masculine man will be seen as charming and sensual for flipping over his arm on a girl.

I dont want to be a closed ""nice"" relationship guy while other men already had 30 girls at the age of 18, either youre the one whos getting loads of ons and casual sex, or youre the one who getting exploited by girls by giving them your time as a male for going out with them for shopping, buying them diner etc.

I will never be a sexual satisfication for the women, my body is unmasculine and ugly. But you know what? I would even fucking accept it, but only with getting a legal castration, but no, our society doesnt care about unattractive low class males. So i even tried to castrate myself.

sex is a basic human need just like water, you cant ignore it or turn it off, so either you are genetically blessed to live it out or you are naturally selected out like me, but in the 2nd case theres no help you will get from society, i dont get it why men like have to torture themselves. I dont want to socialize or getting a job etc. i want a peacefully isolated life without any sex drives etc. plus never getting in the near of women, since they have zero empathy for unmasculine men. My other plan was getting a 100k credit for serveral re-masculinization surgeries, but sadly thats most likely not possible...

Natural selection dictates our way of life, nothing else...

I want to live a life as a full masculine male or a life as a isolated but still peacefully and happy guy NOTHING INBETWEEN ",suicide,"cutted my wrists last nightim now in a psychiatry, ive tried serveral times to kill myself  if you have klinefelter plus living in a western feminized society where people put their emotions over brutal honest rational logical thinking, then youre really fucked and i mean really fucked  ive tried to castrate myself serveral times didnt worked , im at a point life where i just want to give up  im absolutely undesireable to the opposite sex, if you say something in our todays society, you get answers like there someone for everyone out there  most humans are to narcissistic to accept their trur nature, humans are actually nothing else than animals who walk on 2 feet, humans arent individuals, human behaviour is primitive and easy to classify in a big collective, we are not complex individual modern beings, funnywise most people doesnt even know that our dna code never changed since the beginning of mankind  our society is basically nothing else than a big hypocrisy   it is senseless to live as a klinefelter male, you will only experience frustration through being selected out by men and especially women  a ugly non masculine man is getting called a perv, often alone for only having frontal baldness, while a masculine man will be seen as charming and sensual for flipping over his arm on a girl  i dont want to be a closed nice relationship guy while other men already had 30 girls at the age of 18, either youre the one whos getting loads of ons and casual sex, or youre the one who getting exploited by girls by giving them your time as a male for going out with them for shopping, buying them diner etc  i will never be a sexual satisfication for the women, my body is unmasculine and ugly but you know what? i would even fucking accept it, but only with getting a legal castration, but no, our society doesnt care about unattractive low class males so i even tried to castrate myself  sex is a basic human need just like water, you cant ignore it or turn it off, so either you are genetically blessed to live it out or you are naturally selected out like me, but in the 2nd case theres no help you will get from society, i dont get it why men like have to torture themselves i dont want to socialize or getting a job etc i want a peacefully isolated life without any sex drives etc plus never getting in the near of women, since they have zero empathy for unmasculine men my other plan was getting a 100k credit for serveral re masculinization surgeries, but sadly thats most likely not possible   natural selection dictates our way of life, nothing else   i want to live a life as a full masculine male or a life as a isolated but still peacefully and happy guy nothing inbetween ",487
14865,"Fighting the current that is me circling the drainWhere to begin? I was talking with a dear friend recently when it hit me. The perfect word for how I feel about my life is ""bleak"".

I am dating someone that I have no desire to share my deepest fears and struggles with despite us being together for 3 or 4 years now and living together.

I had cancer so I have some large and lovely scars from all that shit. It drained a ton of money out of my savings. Now, it wasn't necessarily that the medical bills were crazy. It was more the lack of income from being off work for so long.

After all that, I stupidly got sold on a timeshare... Yeah. I'm a dumbass. I figured, eh no big deal I can always lose a bit then sell it if we don't need it. Turns out those point based timeshares have literally almost ZERO dollars of resale value.

Let's see what next....
I never went to college bc I didn't know what I wanted to do. I still don't. I'm almost 35 and lost as ever. I am smart but have no particular skills that make me special.

I borrowed money from a good friend to pay rent once. He is a good guy who doesn't lord it over me and knows I am good for it. But yet... I can't get ahead. I've changed jobs and my income hasn't been as steady or great as hoped. I'm barely keeping my head above water.

I see no resolution to any problems in sight.

I'm a Pos human who is attention-detailed only bc I care too much what people think.

I know my family would miss me. Mom probably the most. The gf would probably just move to her home area with her family.

I wanted to be successful in some regard but every day I'm reminded how I never will be.

I told my close friend that I admitted to myself that I will never own a house the other day. (it's a big deal to me.)

Today she told me that her and her hubby just paid off theirs. I was rather stunned.

I just don't see an end in sight. I want to know I have even a shred of a use or purpose, but I never will.

Im just a shitty cog in a big mechanism. A cog that is irrelevant to any reality. Irrelevant cogs can disappear without a fuss.


I've thought about it a lot. How I would do it. I think a car accident would the easiest way to go without anyone   assuming or definitively knowing wayward intentions. Any other good options?

I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life.

I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it?  


My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.

Right now I kind of just wish I hadn't woken up in the middle of the night, I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing. Love (of any kind) seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment. Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me, left or died? I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now.

so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

11347,"Now with $18k in debt, my boyfriend has got his other partner pregnantI don't even know where to begin. Polyamory isn't hard, but his other partner has been making it hard for about 8 months.
I'm not mom material, but I did my best with his child from his previous marriage.
Last night he comes forward saying his secondary partner is pregnant. They took acid together at some concert and in their state, disrespected our fluid bond.
Of course she's going to keep it. She thought she couldn't get pregnant, so it's a miracle. And her family is Catholic.
He says no one ever wanted to push me out of the relationship. Of course he didn't. Of course he doesn't feel like she wanted to push me out. I feel like she wanted to push me out since day 1.
I used to be debt free, now I'm $18k in debt. I'm selling plasma for groceries for fucks sake. And now I can't leave. I have no liquidity, my credit cards are maxed out. I took a better paying job a month ago. So that's great but my time on job isn't going to help me escape.
I just don't want to get out of bed. My stomach hurts, my eyes are swollen disgustingly large. None of that matters.  I don't want to leave the room. His other partner is coming over today. Later this evening, but still 

The worst part is, he's an amazing person. He's not an abuser at all. He's an amazing father. He's paid all the bills, working long hours to make me comfortable. He wanted to try to find his own happiness because his marriage was so unhappy. I love him very much. He wants me to continue to be in his life. I can see he's not happy about the possibility of another baby. His first one was an accidental blessing. But of course she's going to keep it. And I'm just going to leave them to raise this miracle baby in the well decorated house I paid for, because I wanted him to be happy and at peace in his environment instead of the tension and discomfort from his previous marriage.
I just paid $18k and destroyed my credit for my partner to have a future with another woman.
She can't work full time. She makes her money selling her art. And he complains that I work too much. 
I just don't want to do this anymore.
I had a 700 credit score and a healthy car loan, now I'm 30 with $18k I invested in forever, and I've lost it all. And I don't know what to do so I guess I'll stay in bed until I figure it out.

You wonder if you did it because you just weren’t good enough...or strong enough...or smart enough.

You feel guilt for a long time...but then you go numb, because you know deep down, feeling guilty doesn’t really do anything...it doesn’t really make you a better person...because it doesn’t change anything...it doesn’t change what you did. Feeling bad starts feeling good...because you know that bad is all you should feel...so you’re finally doing the right thing...you hate yourself...and that’s good...the only good you have in you.

You know that when people think about what you are, they picture a greasy haired, fat, smelly bastard...with dandruff on his shoulders...and potato chips in his patchy beard...who never brushes his teeth...who drives a taxi...and watches children play in the park while he jacks off in the bushes. You know people think you’re not smart...or capable of good; you’re like a rat to them...you’re mind is a shit sewer...you’re a bug...you’re the dog shit under someone’s shoe...and then...eventually...you just believe it...because you can’t defend yourself...not really...because you’re not a good person...it’s easier to just see yourself the way everyone else does. 

The self loathing feels good...you start to realize you don’t really care about...anything...anymore. You wonder if you can make the feeling bigger...you want it to be all you feel...you want to be even more numb...and by the time the pills are in your mouth...you’re not even scared...because it’s long overdue. 

I picked pills because I’m a coward...I should use a gun...but whatever...it doesn’t really matter now...I’m just waiting for them to take effect...it shouldn’t be much longer. 

I love you mom...and I’m sorry Chloe. I don’t know why I did what I did to you...I hope you never remember it...but don’t worry...you don’t have to be afraid of me...I know what I need to do...it’ll all be over soon. 

I died today...but I don’t regret it. Keep an eye on your kids...don’t let them turn into me.

10456,"I have thoughts of committing suicide lately 

Hello guys

I wish to you a very good day. So I would like to tell a bit about me.

I'm a guy who has 23 years old, And I'm Agnostic. And I live in a strictly Middle Eastern Islamic country.

I used to believe in religion but now I don't because all the violence which I figured out in it

I'm hiding my disbelieve in the religion for my own safety. My life will be threatened if my agnosticism revealed. I could be 'infidel' in the eyes of the religious people.

I was always dreaming of living in a place which I can confess that I'm Agnostic and living in peace without getting my life threatened.

I wanted to have a partner and children who I can bring them up on my beliefs

I don't like to date the girls of this country because the majority of them are Muslims

Anyway it's prohibited and unallowed for the girls of this country to meet or talk with a guy

So here's what happened. I met a girl who is a foreigner she is a Muslim but she is very modern and has the characteristics of the girl which I have always dreamt of them.

We started to talk she was interested in me as a lover and so I am in the beginning

As days go by. I attached to her so much!. I liked her personality!. And I wanted to marry her!.

After we met several times and talk to each other she started to not be interested in me as a lover anymore but only a friend. But my interest in her as a lover was remaining. I didn't know that she started to see me only as a friend.

Our meetings remained. And one day I found out that she has a fiance. I was totally in shock. How could she has a one while she is with me?. I confronted her of that and she said that's nothing of your business you are only my friend.

At this moment I figured out that she was seeing me only as a friend which puts in a severe depression and makes me look down to myself because she chose him instead of me. The world got so dark and abandoned in my eyes. And I felt that everything is tight on me. Because the girl of my dreams falls in the arms of another man.

I started to have thoughts of committing suicide and telling to myself this is enough of living this life. Thoughts have come to my mind mentioning to me that I will never get out of this place and I will never get a partner Just end your life

Please, guys, I would like to hear your advice.

10462,"Can't care anymoreI've lost my ability to care about everything anymore. I have 6 weeks left of college and I can't imagine doing anything except waiting to die.

At the beginning of the semester I was doing ok and had some passion for once, excited to finish up. I've lost that and I'm at my lowest point.

I cannot relate to people well. I have a terrible time talking with anyone, it is a hindrance of my existence. The most I can pull off is humor which is nice but I can't do anything else. I have trouble expressing feelings, deeper thoughts, small talk, just about everything. So I can't  explain properly why I feel like shit to those around me. I've been off/on with a girl a bit but now I've accepted I'm not her type, and she is really hard for me to understand. She has more layers of complications than I can deal with and is by far better at talking. I don’t know where we stand right now except as friends but I feel like a giant bother to her.

I have made some friends at college but the connections feel loose now. Half of them have openly expressed wanting to kill themselves. They have plans that stop them from doing it, same as me I guess, but I think I'm losing mine.

I've started a few unhealthy things, one of them being cutting. I never really understood it before but I get it now. The other being fasting. For past few weeks I've been keeping track of calories to lose weight, but now I have taken it very drastically. Im above 350 lbs so my only options are dramatic or long periods of time. I decided dramatic now.

I have a meeting with my school counseling on Thursday and am going to explain everything. Probably use this post as a guide to help me talk. It's really the only thing I'm sort of looking forward to now. Because it is the only way I can tell someone what's happening without feeling like a burden.

I'm taking lexapro for depression and have half a dose for when things get real shitty. I don't know if taking the extra will help now since it takes time to work into the system. I might but I'm expecting to end up in an institution for a while if the counselor needs me to be in one.

Also most of my family is in the Midwest and I'm in Massachusetts on my own. I talk to my mom about every week but that's about the only contact I have back home. 

I'm just kind of done. I tried faking it til I made it but I can't anymore. I just want out.",suicide,"can t care anymorei ve lost my ability to care about everything anymore i have 6 weeks left of college and i can t imagine doing anything except waiting to die  at the beginning of the semester i was doing ok and had some passion for once, excited to finish up i ve lost that and i m at my lowest point  i cannot relate to people well i have a terrible time talking with anyone, it is a hindrance of my existence the most i can pull off is humor which is nice but i can t do anything else i have trouble expressing feelings, deeper thoughts, small talk, just about everything so i can t explain properly why i feel like shit to those around me i ve been off/on with a girl a bit but now i ve accepted i m not her type, and she is really hard for me to understand she has more layers of complications than i can deal with and is by far better at talking i dont know where we stand right now except as friends but i feel like a giant bother to her  i have made some friends at college but the connections feel loose now half of them have openly expressed wanting to kill themselves they have plans that stop them from doing it, same as me i guess, but i think i m losing mine  i ve started a few unhealthy things, one of them being cutting i never really understood it before but i get it now the other being fasting for past few weeks i ve been keeping track of calories to lose weight, but now i have taken it very drastically im above 350 lbs so my only options are dramatic or long periods of time i decided dramatic now  i have a meeting with my school counseling on thursday and am going to explain everything probably use this post as a guide to help me talk it s really the only thing i m sort of looking forward to now because it is the only way i can tell someone what s happening without feeling like a burden  i m taking lexapro for depression and have half a dose for when things get real shitty i don t know if taking the extra will help now since it takes time to work into the system i might but i m expecting to end up in an institution for a while if the counselor needs me to be in one  also most of my family is in the midwest and i m in massachusetts on my own i talk to my mom about every week but that s about the only contact i have back home  i m just kind of done i tried faking it til i made it but i can t anymore i just want out ",485
15774,"I feel doneI'm just so tired of everything. I went to a therapist at my university. The first session went well and I was hopeful that I was doing something to improve my life. I went to the second one and it started off okish. But then she said I must feel stuck (which is true) and it's something that has really affected me and I feel like my depression had greatly affected my motivation in general and I have an overall fear of making decisions. I explained to her my circumstances and why I have these fears. I was hoping to work through these but she kept insisting that I felt stuck and I was not ready to change. That I had a wall up and she had been trying various methods during the session when, at least in my view, she just kept repeating the phrase I am stuck. I don't understand why she kept assuming I don't want to change my circumstances and she made me feel very unwelcome. She said I should come back when I feel ready to work through things and then suddenly asked if I was going to schedule another session. I honestly started tearing up because I felt like I was saying very personal things trying to explain why I do these things and how I am feeling. The fact that I go to therapy on my own terms is me trying. I felt like she was making assumptions and making me feel very unwelcome by the end of the session. She said she sensed an ambivalence in me , which I do as a result of my depression, and she just started to look at me very differently. I feel like she wanted me to be really happy and want to start a brand new amazing life but I'm in one of my worst depressive episodes. The first session I had with her I had gotten a lot of sleep, looked put together, and acted happy for the majority of the time. I just feel violated that she saw me at my worst and said I wasn't trying hard enough for her continue to treat me. No patient is perfect and I'm going there because I have problems like this. I know every therapist has different methods but for someone who practices ACT I was appalled. And she said maybe she pushed too hard but I needed to be more ready. I skipped all of my classes for the day and cried in my dorm room because I was so upset. I just want to kill myself to stop feeling this emptiness. At least that way I'll have made a decision and I don't have to deal with people using me or judging me instead of caring about my happiness.

4859,"The aftermath of a suicide - please readI know so many of you are hurting. But I need you to know something. The aftermath of a suicide is like nothing you could possibly imagine. Tomorrow will be 3 months since we buried our 17 year old son. He was the second of 5 children. He suffered from depression and anxiety, had had multiple hospitalizations, meds and doctors. We would have done anything he needed. In the months that have passed, our family has suffered more than anyone could fathom. My children cry themselves to sleep plenty of nights. My husband is a walking zombie. I cry around the clock and cannot function. I don’t judge a single one of you. I love you all and wish I could take your pain. But try....really truly try. Tell your parents, your loved ones and if they don’t help, keep trying. You have a purpose. What you may ask? To light the candle for others suffering. So they know they are not alone, not to blame for how they feel and that someday we will find a cure. You are NOT your depression. That is a separate beast that is stealing who you truly are. It isn’t different from cancer. Treatments are weak at this point, but we are all trying and fighting for you all. So no, don’t listen to depression telling you that you are a burden. No one is better off without your light. The world will forever change without your path. Yes, these are dark times, but suicide submerges All who love you (and although you don’t think so - again depression is tricking you) will suffer. And they will suffer for an eternity. But they won’t have a way out because they will see and experience the aftermath. I have mixed feelings about this forum. Some messages are loving, others are speaking via depression. I wish you spent a day with a survivor so that you saw the pain and suffering. And that it would allow you to understand that depression is your enemy. It’s tricking you and stealing you. But it is not you. Love you all. Tomorrow, 3 months out will be another day of hell while we battle our guilt, despair, failure, self hatred and pain of missing our son. That is the aftermath of a suicide. Every single one. I am a mother of an angel. Please try again today to find the strength to fight, if not for yourself - for the community of mothers, fathers, siblings, friends, grandparents, children and everyone who will never forgive themselves no matter what you write in a note. You cannot sum up a lifetime in these notes. You cannot understand that you were loved from the second you arrived with a love from so many that you are unaware would have taken your place to have you back here in an instant.

8078,"Relationship with older guyI don't know where to post this.
I had a doctor about 7 years ago who helped me with my problems when I was younger. Nothing happened here, of course. Strictly professional. In the last two years, we started talking again and he would give me advice. We got closer and closer and things started changing. He helped me come into myself as a gay adult. But things started changing when he started buying me things. I've never asked for anything, but he's offered to by me things for my birthday, etc. I accepted. I was broke at the time and appreciative. I've talked to him about it. He knows I don't want anything sexual and he understands. He'd never want to push me to do anything sexual. It isn't a sugar daddy situation, quite. I don't even know how to describe it... I supposed he's just generous and he and his husband have extra money (and yes, his husband knows.) He's even given me several thousand dollars when I was struggling to pay rent. I've offered to pay him back several times and he refuses.
What it comes down to is that we're close friends and he and his husband like helping others.. paying friends and family to help them through struggling times makes them happy and makes them feel purposeful. Here's where it gets bad... I told my parents today that he was thinking about getting an apartment in this city... he and his husband like to come visit me and see shows. He asked that, if they got an apartment, would I be interested in housesitting since they wouldn't be coming that much. I told my parents that I might have a housesitting opportunity and they called him a predator. They told me to pay him back for everything immediately (they saw in my bank account that he had sent me money.) They said this isn't normal. They said not to talk to him. To only be professional. They said he's after something. I don't know what to do... this is after he said he loved me today but he's trying to get over it. He knows nothing will come out of it but now I'm convinced I'm in the wrong. He says he knows we're just friends. But my parents are so upset. They only know about him giving me money and offering for me to housesit.
I'm a mess right now and probably am explaining things poorly. Someone please help me. I don't know what to do. Is he a predator? Is there something wrong with this relationship? I didn't think there was until my parents brought it up.

10919,"I now have a gun, and I dont know how much longer Ill be here.The past 5 years or so Ive had consistent thoughts of death. Sometimes its in the back of my mind, other times its the only thing I can focus on. I feel completely isolated (which is my fault,) and I have zero hope that I'll ever have the tools or knowledge to be happy. Ive came close a few times, I've been hospitalized, but all its really come down to is the Dr. saying ""Here are a few options of pills you can take."" and Ive tried several and they all just..dont work. Ive never been able to explain what these pills do to me, but they do not take away the pain of just being forced to live. I feel like I have no ""family"" by the common definition. My parents divorced because my father is emotionally abusive, my siblings all got into heavy drugs and left, my mom just gave up and dropped me off at my dads one day and moved away and I only hear or see her a few times a year on a good year. I dont think she really thinks much of me. My relationship with my father is awful. And I can't blame him for all of it. He has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive to me but at the same time Ive given him reasons to be. Ive been a failure for so long. Ive struggled to hold a job, I do drugs far more than I should, and Ive stolen alcohol and pills from him before because I cant deal with the pain that I create for myself.

But now I dont feel so forced to be this way, because I can be dead. Im scared of death, I feel like we all are. Becoming nothing is a hard thought to accept, but living has become even more terrifying, and It takes more strength to live than It does to die, strength that I feel like I've run out of. Ive noticed it does feel different going about my life with the gun under my bed. Its almost easier getting out of bed now and doing small things knowing that I am not forced to endure the same pain tomorrow, making every effort feel pointless. The next time I am feeling this unreal pain, or nothing at all, Ill go out into the woods, and put a bullet into my brain.

It's funny, because I have a doctors appointment on the first of next month because I want to talk to him about seeing a specialist for my problems. But now that I have a way out, I no longer care much for the idea of trying to fix myself and failing like I always have.

12243,"I just can't handle life as a human being. 4 years ago I was arrested for assault with intent to kill. When I got fed up with the way ""customers"" and I use that term only to describe the human trash that frequented but never purchased anyway from the establishment for which I was employed, I decided to quit. My boss didn't take the idea of my quitting lightly and attacked me. I retaliated and did permanent damage to his body and mind. I was convicted and sentenced to jail. That's where I spent the last 4 years, isolated and under constant attack until 2 months ago. 

I've been trying to rebuild my life. Everything I owned was thrown away and I lost my car. I didn't have much money because I've never made much money. I find myself in a position where I feel nothing but hate towards everyone I interact with. Hate isn't a descriptive enough term or word to describe my feelings towards others. It's not necessarily the individual I hate, it's human nature. The asinine reasoning that ends up with me cleaning up a mess that shouldn't of happened or having conversation that's going nowhere. I watch TV and it's nothing but a very basic set of problems that could be solved if human nature wasn't so broken. Just listening to others makes me want to leave this place. I have no connection to anyone here. I can't function in a world like this. I think what really turned me against everyone the most other than being around them were all the different therapists I was forced to deal with in jail. Talking to them was like pulling teeth. All they did was turn me against any kind of therapy or help for the rest of my life.

It's just horrible how stupid most people are. It's not worth the time or trouble to weed though the bad ones to find someone I can relate to. I'm not talking about companionship either. I already know that's an unreasonable expectation. I'm talking about finding someone you can work with so there's a chance of being half way successful in this screwed up world. 

Since it's too much trouble to have anyone or anything in my life I'm going to kill myself. A life without advancement is bad enough, a life around you people makes it even worse. I'm leaving this world because I don't want to wake up another day feeling trapped like I for the better part of the last decade. 

I'll leave you all to your worthless miserable lives. My only regret is not being able to watch the worthless sap that will have to clean up the mess I'm about to leave.

12833,"WHAT'S UP FELLOW KIDS! How'd you like to join a totally normal Minecrafter server that just happens to be modded? Please. We're board and need more people on the server. The server itself is already paid for, so you just need to install the mods!

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this seems like a lot, but honestly, setting everything up takes AT MOST 30 minutes. If you're interested, DM me and read the stuff below! We have up to 60 open slots on the server at a time and a discord.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCORD CODE:** HTmwmv

&amp;#x200B;

Hey! Our server is a modded Minecrafter server that uses mods designed to run on the latest version of Forge. We have several mods including an advanced electrical mod, Flan's gun mod, Modern Warfare mod, nuclear mod and several more! The server is a psuedo-roleplay where you take on the role of a specific country. You can be any country you want, as long as it isn't taken and you must follow the rules below:

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic or the like. Really, just don't be a dick.
* If you want to have an official war with someone, YOU MUST DECLARE IT IN THE UN MEETINGS. (yes, we have a UN tower that's a work in progress)
* Don't harass other players
* Have fun
* Feel free to use the nukes, but don't nuke the UN. That is safe grounds
* For heaven's sake, and for the sake of all that's holy, DON'T USE THE F!@#ING BALEFIRE BOMB.

&amp;#x200B;

**BASES:**

When you join in, we'll either let you go into creative for 30 minutes to build a base, or we might give you the materials, as some of the materials are a little OP. Feel free to build bases away from the UN, but you should have one near the UN, preferably your main one.

&amp;#x200B;

**PC REQUIREMENTS:**

I can run the server pretty well with a 64 bit system and 8 GB of ram. You don't need a high-end computer, but you really can't have one that's too slow.

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT:**

I should note that we do use a service called Forge for the mods. The server is already set up. You are not paying for anything, if anything you're just installing the Forge client which allows your Minecraft app to interpret the mods. Forge is not malware, it is a documented and highly reliable service. If you don't believe me, google it! If you don't already have it you WILL HAVE TO INSTALL FORGE. For some reason having to put in 10 minutes worth of work is a turnoff for some people... **IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS OR GET STUCK, ASK ME!**",non-suicide,"what s up fellow kids how d you like to join a totally normal minecrafter server that just happens to be modded? please we re board and need more people on the server the server itself is already paid for, so you just need to install the mods  amp x200b  i apologize if this seems like a lot, but honestly, setting everything up takes at most 30 minutes if you re interested, dm me and read the stuff below we have up to 60 open slots on the server at a time and a discord  amp x200b   discord code  htmwmv  amp x200b  hey our server is a modded minecrafter server that uses mods designed to run on the latest version of forge we have several mods including an advanced electrical mod, flan s gun mod, modern warfare mod, nuclear mod and several more the server is a psuedo roleplay where you take on the role of a specific country you can be any country you want, as long as it isn t taken and you must follow the rules below  amp x200b   don t be racist, homophobic, transphobic or the like really, just don t be a dick  if you want to have an official war with someone, you must declare it in the un meetings  yes, we have a un tower that s a work in progress  don t harass other players  have fun  feel free to use the nukes, but don t nuke the un that is safe grounds  for heaven s sake, and for the sake of all that s holy, don t use the f @ ing balefire bomb  amp x200b   bases   when you join in, we ll either let you go into creative for 30 minutes to build a base, or we might give you the materials, as some of the materials are a little op feel free to build bases away from the un, but you should have one near the un, preferably your main one  amp x200b   pc requirements   i can run the server pretty well with a 64 bit system and 8 gb of ram you don t need a high end computer, but you really can t have one that s too slow  amp x200b   important   i should note that we do use a service called forge for the mods the server is already set up you are not paying for anything, if anything you re just installing the forge client which allows your minecraft app to interpret the mods forge is not malware, it is a documented and highly reliable service if you don t believe me, google it if you don t already have it you will have to install forge for some reason having to put in 10 minutes worth of work is a turnoff for some people   if you don t know how to do this or get stuck, ask me  ",484
13196,"i hate myself and dont know what to doill cut to the chase. when i was 17 i groped a friend while i thought she was asleep. even though i was drunk i knew it was wrong and i thought the best thing to do was to not talk about it with her again, because i thought it would reopen trauma. recently she called me out for it. i apologized for it finally and apologized for not saying anything to her. 

well it turns out what i did mentally affected her for a long time and i messed up her life. i offered regret and remorse and made it clear that i learned from it and would never do anything like it again, which i havent. i focus on being humble and the best person i can be. the girl does not want anything to do with me which i completely understand, but i know it was the right thing to do to finally try and reach out to her and offer to help her in any way i can. i blame her for nothing and she went through a lot of other hard traumatic stuff unrelated to what i did to her, but i certainly caused her much trauma and pain.

i also told my girlfriend that i love and had been dating for almost two years, and she broke up with me. i am incredibly broken right now and didn't even show up for work today. my relationship appears to be over even though my now ex girlfriend says she still loves me but can't see me the same way. everything was going great and i planned to spend the rest of my life with her(my first love) and now she does not want to continue with me romantically.

11337,"I'm a failure.There's no other real way of putting it and it's one one the hardest realizations I've had to come to but I'm a dumbass. I'm not just saying that. So here's so backstory. My entire life I've been in low level classes. I've always done mediocre in those classes. So on Monday, I had a Really really hard US Government test. Ok, so I study my ass off during the day on Monday. It is my last class and I had a free period(substitute teacher) , study hall, and then lunch, then this class. I studied the ENTIRE time, went STRAIGHT to the library and didn't look up from my book once, re read the chapter, made friends with a smart kid in my class whk lend me some note cards to study from. Ok I got this, I go into take the test and I fucking bomb it. I got a 46%. On Tuesday I had a physics quiz. Ok, I my parents who am so thankful for hire me one of the best physics tutors in thr city. I study, I understand the material (or so I thaught). I got a fucking FOUR out of 20. The lowest grade in the class. Granted most people got 10/20's I still felt like I have down syndrome. This blonde bimbo in the class who says the most retarded shit gets the highest grade being an 85. Tuesday I also had a math test. Again, I have a tutor for this, one I've been seeing for months. A close friend of my teacher. I actually study a lot and think I know the material. Leaving the test my body physically felt numb.all that fucking studying and I still fucking didn't know how to do some of the problems. I don't know what I got on this one yet but I feel like if I fucking think about grades of college one more fucking time I think I'm going to explode. I have such a shitty GPA I am dreaming of getting into a shitty state school. Meanwhile my friends make Jokes about the idiots who go to the schools I want to go to. Every time we have a college meeting we get a pice if paper with our GPA on if and shit and every single time every kid is showing thier grades and shit meanwhile I'm pretending not to exist. I feel so fucking useless and dumb I don't even know what to think. I'm such a dissapointment to my parents, to myslef to everybody. Fuck. Worst part is nobody will even reply to me and this will be ignored as per usual with all my posts on reddit. Hope someone else has a better week than I do.

889,"Week 1 of grad school and I'm already a failureI started grad school last week. I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.

I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.

With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm.

2056,"Is this actually DBT, or is this just bad therapy for depression?My therapist's response to ""I wish I could die without affecting anyone else,"" was ""Well that's impossible. Of course people who love you would miss you. I would miss you. It would be devastating!""   That seems little short of guilt tripping.  I won't say it's totally ineffective, but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist.  Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention? Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world.  Like, Sorry, you're ok and all, but you're just my therapist. I don't even know you.  Self harm has been officially unamed ""unacceptable,"" and is punnishable by 24 hours of no contact/no phone coaching.  Phone coaching, the thing they're supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying (again) to kill yourself... If somebody's so desperate they're self-harming, possibly with intent to kill.  You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost.  For the love of god, why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything, and if they get it for being ""good"" (presenting as asymptomatic) and not for being ""bad"" (symptomatic), they'll stop self harming or attempting suicide (being symptomatic)?   You cannot just *manipulate* me out of being suicidal.  That's not how this works.  I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly... heavy-duty, or industrial strength or whatever.  Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people.  That's what I came for, but I'm not sure what it is that I'm getting.  It assumes people are illogical attention-motivated children above all else.   While I'm not some mastermind genius, I find that pretty insulting.  What, do I get a gold star for each day without self-harm, too?  I know! Let's go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy.  /s  I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, and this shit does not jive with what I've been taught to expect of DBT.  I'm disappointed, really.  Flat out salty.  That and it's full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out.  My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it's a proper noun or something. Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence.

9422,"I'm gonna miss everyone. It's for the best.Sorry, I'm just really bad at, well, everything. A backstory is a bit of a bitch, so I'll keep it short:

I've been depressed for 4 years now. Fucked up a lot in elementary school, middle school was social hell (no friends AT ALL; my entire school hated me for whatever reasons they had), and now I'm a sophomore in high school, ready to end it.

I've been getting in a lot of arguments with my mom lately. I'm trying to get my grades up, because I've been just too emotionally exhausted and weighed down by what feels like some boundless darkness tht I didn't do a LOT of my schoolwork. I've slept through entire days, gone to school drunk/high, lied my ass off for everything, ruined my parents' lives, and most recently, become a sexually promiscuous demon.

I've stressed my mom and dad out so much over the past year, since they only found out I was depressed in September 2012 and I've had about 4 attempts since then. I've completely scared the shit out of my brother. A 12 year old kid with a brother who's constantly bringing home one problem after another. Drugs, drinking, sex, apathy, rebellion, and too much for a family to bear.

I've lived my fair share an havent done anything to justify it. I've ruined far too many friendships I had, run down the most amazing teachers this world has to offer, and most importantly, killed my parents' sanity. It would really be best if I just leave.

My mom is threatening to send me to military school and I'm the most wiry boy you'll ever meet, and 6'3"". She warps her memories and then calls me a liar when I've written down what she's said and done, moments after the fact. I've **ruined** them. Emotionally and financially. I can't stand being such a fuck up and a leech. It'll be for the best.

I can't imagine why they'd miss me, or anyone would, for that matter. I've fucked up throughout my whole life. I can't think of a single moment where I can say ""Hey, I wasn't a total moron that one time!"" I've just been an endless disappointment to everyone around me.

I'm so useless. Literally, the one good thing I've found out about myself is that people can effectively use me as a writing surface for paper and pencil. I want to die and finally say I've done the right thing. I love everyone. I want what's best for you, and I think this is best.

7019,"I dont see things getting much betterClearly, if I'm posting here im not 100% wanting to die. In fact, I really wish life could be better for me. I just dont believe I will get better. My issues come from a lot of trauma, and I've been in therapy for more than 3 years. I consistently do things to try to better my life. I try to make healthier decisions, I try to be a better person, and I try to employ the ""fake it til you make it"" method of being happy (not in a disingenuous way just trying to make good habits). I have some good days. I have some comfortable and quiet days. I do not necessarily have happy days. And, more so than the former, I have a lot of really hard moments and days. 


I'm tired of feeling haunted. I'm tired of the hauntings always coming back, and always getting in the way. I feel like I'm doing everything I can, maybe I'm not, i dont know. But at what point is it just the rational decision to accept the reality of circumstance? There are plenty of people trapped to cycles of mindsets and behaviors they cannot change, or are almost incapable of changing. 


On my best days, I do not believe in much besides biology and chance. Things have no meaning besides what you give them. If I were capable of feeling safe and comfortable, then I would be happy finding things that I have meaning in. And i try to do this. But I can't have the basic foundation of stability. On my worst days, I am convinced that the world, or at least my own world, is plagued with pain. The one thing I can believe in is pain. It is consistent and promised and not fake. I cannot believe in anything else as genuinely as I can pain. 


At what point is limiting the amount of pain I continue to endure or encounter the more rational decision, rather than being a sitting duck waiting for the next trauma to come? Or the next affirmation that I cannot trust myself nor others? Or the next proof that there is no good around me. I dont want to wait for those things. My hauntings convince me those things are coming, whether they are or not. Which makes those things reality anyways. 


I'm tired of the moments where I feel completely despaired and fearful. Not even entirely sure what my body and mind are dreading most of the time, sometimes my mind just rationalizes that intense fear by creating paranoid thoughts. And then I lose my sense of self and reality even more. It's awful to have flashbacks and nightmares and then paranoia. Its awful to believe everything can and will hurt me. I'm tired.

7921,"I’m Just So Done and FrustratedI have never been this depressed in my entire life....it has never been this bad before and I’m so tired of crying every single day and being in an eternal anxiety attack....

Over 3 months ago I moved back to my home state, leaving the city I always dreamed of and loved. I didn’t think it would be a big deal leaving my $50000 job because I’ve never had issues finding a job before.

A little over a month after I moved, I got offered a great job, with what I thought was a great company and great money. Well turns out they had decided to eliminate the position I had originally been offered so that left me with no job. (Upon further research of the company they are involved in a lot of sketchy things).

I started looking for other jobs and now it’s been 2 months and I am just so done. I have never had an issue finding a job before but this time has been awful. I’ve been to over 50 interviews and none of them have done anywhere, except for one that I was offered from the hiring manager that was then denied by the owner of the company because I would have been the only female besides the hiring manager there and he only wants guys working there (I am in the process of filing a complaint against them). 

I’ve had no money for 2 months because I had let my boyfriend use it all because I didn’t think I’d be having this much trouble. My relationship is deteriorating by the day because now neither one of us have money and he blames me for every thing because I ran out of money. 

I’ve gone to staffing agencies (which have all been sketchy and advertise jobs they don’t even have) who have nothing. I’ve been to counselors who have told me to take things off my resume (my master’s degrees and a lot of my previous employment) because it shows all my experience and places aren’t going to want to pay what I’ve previously been paid. Nothing has worked.

I went from an average of $24 an hour, to lowering myself to $18, then $16, then $12 (which I haven’t made since I was 16) and realizing I’m going to be working 2 or 3 jobs just to get us an apartment and yet I still can’t get a job. 

There is no money. At all. I don’t even have gas to go see him. My friends (some of who I’ve been staying with) are all so done with me begging for money all the time.

I seriously just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve never been in this position before and I’ve lost every thing and nothing is getting better....

Today my sister practically told me that I'm useless, that at my age I should be successful and well enough established financially. She then had the fucking gall to tell me that she wouldn't be where I am right now when she got to my age, and that she was disappointed in me.

Yeah? Well did you forget about the last 20 fucking years? The years when Dad was unstable? When we had that violent piece of shit of a brother hanging around making everyone miserable? Did you forget how 16 years ago I took a course I didn't want just so I could finish college ASAP, find a fucking job ASAP, and for the next 12 years slave away to support our fucking family?

Where the hell do you think most of my money went, you inconsiderate, piece of shit bitch?!

11957,"I just can't go on any moreIt's been four months since my wife left me (for no apparent reason). Our marriage only lasted for three years, but they were the only good years of my life. I've been trying so hard for these past few months, and I've been so sure that if I just stayed positive then eventually I'd start to feel better, but it's only getting worse.

I need her in my life. I have nothing to look forward to any more. Weekends are just a long stretch of loneliness. I've been working hard on bettering myself, working 40 hour weeks and pursuing a master's degree, but what's the point? None of it makes me the least bit happy. And I'm just too goddamn tired after a long week of work and school to get out and try to socialize. Not that I would even know how to do that. Instead I'm stuck in a shitty town that I hate because I moved here to be with her because I thought that if I just tried harder then we could make it work.

I have an almost 6 figure salary, no debt, I'm reasonably attractive, I'm still young-ish (well, under 30...) and on paper it seems like my life couldn't be better. I completely lack large-group social skills, but that's the only thing holding me back. I've tried dating again but despite reasonable success on Tinder I just haven't felt any better. What's the point, anyways? Even if I start another relationship it'll probably just end like my last one did.

I know that I need to find something I like in myself. A reason to keep living that isn't dependent on someone else. But no matter how hard I look, there just isn't one. I tried talking to a therapist a couple years back who told me that she couldn't help me and maybe I should talk to a doctor about getting antidepressants. I've tried antidepressants before. Several different brands. Some made me tired, some didn't, but none of them made me happy. They just made me numb. I'd rather die as myself then live as an empty shell.

Every time the wind rattles the door I think for just a second that maybe it's her and she's finally come back. But I know that she won't. The sad thing is that the last year of our marriage was pretty bad and she grew increasingly distant, but I'd give anything to go back to that.

care.Note: I have been in a depression for a long time. Opened up about it about a year ago. Saw almost all of my friends leave me, one by one when I wasn't useful anymore. I lost my job, got expelled from university for failing to write my final thesis and had to move back to my parents basement. I had one friend left, my best friend, or so I thought. She didn't stay in contact and neither did I much. I wrote two e-mails but that's that. I had hoped she'd care about me even when I wasn't around to do things for her. She didn't. When I hadn't heard from her in two months I wrote to her wishing her well for the future. I thought that it had ended and wanted to at least tell her that I am proud of her for having finished university and all. She replied that she had put her head in the sand instead of writing me and she was sorry. And then she asked if I had my degree and what I was doing now. And I...well...I kinda broke. I told her that I hadn't gotten my degree because, as I told her, I was kicked out. And that quite frankly I have nothing ""exciting to share"" because I was trying not to kill myself and it was pretty hard. I also replied that I knew that I didn't have much to offer in terms of conversations and that it was okay if she didn't want to reply.

And well she didn't. I don't know, I was probably too harsh to her and there is nothing she can do anyway. I am just a burden for everyone and why would she want to talk to me? It's just hard knowing that apart from your parents there isn't a single person who cares. I guess I am wondering if I should try to apologize, get her a present and ask her to forgive me because I really really owe it to my parents not to kill myself and it's just harder when you have no social network at all. That sounds so technical but yeah I sort of miss her, I mean I miss the times when I was still able to do things with her and for her and I know it's unfair to ask someone to be friends with you when you aren't doing anything for them.

Before I start I just wanted to tell everyone *I'**m not Political* but some of my family is and it's annoying and sad to see a rift caused between members due to their political standing.    


Well, where to start? Last year was pretty shitty considering a majority of us had to stay inside (Or didn't care and said fuck it) but I'm writing this today to express some emotions I had bottled up for the past say...I think since March or May of last year.   


But anyways to why were all here-   
I'm fucking tired of politics. Like, One one side you have a bunch of bumbling SJW dick heads who think they know how a black person feels because they're great uncle sister on their mom's side has a black friend and they think they're oppressed like their in fucking slavery and on the other hand you have trump supporting circle jerks who think the president is their ""Daddy UwU"" Like bro I'm tired of seeing these two fightings. I'm tired of reading the news and one side is only getting flacked for what they believed in.   
I can't lie when I say I agree with republicans storming the capital hill. American's like those crazy mother fuckers taken a lot of shit from being fucked over and overall 2020 because their private business couldn't stay alive during this bullshit of a quarantine. I don't condone it but no one seems to know if they didn't do it for trump they could have avoided legal action and possibly an Epstine like death in the future.   


I don't like how people are behaving now too. Everyone's too much of a follower because they want to be famous.   
people don't do what they love anymore unless they really stick with it.   
Some girls got no loyalty anymore  
It's harder to date for me now even though I'm not that bad looking.   
Most of the chicks in my dating pool got dicks   
I begin to realize how unobtainable my old 90's shitboxes' are (The big 3 jdm cars)  
Everything is over-politicized to have people up in arms against their brothers and sisters  
Politicians are not for the people anymore  
Creativity is dead in anything American made.   
I'm too early to explore space and too young to experience the prime of car culture.

5820,"To everyone on this subreddit:Hi,
I’ve been struggling with suicide myself lately.
A couple weeks ago I tried to overdose on alcohol and Benadryl, but only ended up puking my brains out and being unable to walk for a little while. The aftermath of it was disastrous. I was stuck missing people that had left me, feeling like a disappointment because my parents were all over me because I had been smoking weed and I’m still a high school student. My friend group dropped me and continues to threaten to jump me and make fun of me via any means possible, even though I blocked all contact with them. I had ongoing OCD and Depression. I could go on and on, but obviously my situation is bad, and I know that the majority of people on here probably have it worse. However, seeing the grief in my parents eyes, in the eyes of the few friends I still have, and how mortified they were; it really brought to fruition how suicide truly does just give the pain to someone else. Don’t blame yourself for being suicidal, life nowadays is confusing and hard. We’re the most advanced we’ve ever been, and yet suicide is more of an epidemic now than ever. Even if you think you’re alone, you’re not. Even if your mind is telling you that there’s no way someone cares, there is. And even if you truly have no one, that still doesn’t justify it. Patience when feeling these kind of deep emotions can be very hard, when people say it will get better, there’s no telling how long it will take. It could be years, but any amount of pain you feel now is bound to be surmounted by the pleasures and joys and satisfactions that life will give you once you’ve made it over the hill. Everyone has their own mountains to climb, and unfortunately not everyone’s gets to be small. But I promise you matter, and while this is going to sound generic I want to list a few things that may make now not seem so bad. When you feel these lows try:
- Exercise
- Reading
- Napping for a short period of time
- Hot showers
- Swimming
- Chamomile Tea
- Video Games
- Knitting
- Coloring
- Contacting the Suicide Hotline
- Watching self love and motivational videos on YouTube
- Masturbation
- Cooking
- Doing something to train your brain, like a crossword puzzle
- Taking a drive
- Exploring nature
- Listening to music
And there is more to all of that that you can do to manage or alleviate the pain. It will get better, it always does for everyone. Life will not be constantly low, and in the meantime, try to savor and appreciate even the littlest things that bring you joy, whether it be the cool side of the pillow or a cute gif. Stay strong. I love you.",suicide,"to everyone on this subreddit hi, ive been struggling with suicide myself lately a couple weeks ago i tried to overdose on alcohol and benadryl, but only ended up puking my brains out and being unable to walk for a little while the aftermath of it was disastrous i was stuck missing people that had left me, feeling like a disappointment because my parents were all over me because i had been smoking weed and im still a high school student my friend group dropped me and continues to threaten to jump me and make fun of me via any means possible, even though i blocked all contact with them i had ongoing ocd and depression i could go on and on, but obviously my situation is bad, and i know that the majority of people on here probably have it worse however, seeing the grief in my parents eyes, in the eyes of the few friends i still have, and how mortified they were it really brought to fruition how suicide truly does just give the pain to someone else dont blame yourself for being suicidal, life nowadays is confusing and hard were the most advanced weve ever been, and yet suicide is more of an epidemic now than ever even if you think youre alone, youre not even if your mind is telling you that theres no way someone cares, there is and even if you truly have no one, that still doesnt justify it patience when feeling these kind of deep emotions can be very hard, when people say it will get better, theres no telling how long it will take it could be years, but any amount of pain you feel now is bound to be surmounted by the pleasures and joys and satisfactions that life will give you once youve made it over the hill everyone has their own mountains to climb, and unfortunately not everyones gets to be small but i promise you matter, and while this is going to sound generic i want to list a few things that may make now not seem so bad when you feel these lows try  exercise  reading  napping for a short period of time  hot showers  swimming  chamomile tea  video games  knitting  coloring  contacting the suicide hotline  watching self love and motivational videos on youtube  masturbation  cooking  doing something to train your brain, like a crossword puzzle  taking a drive  exploring nature  listening to music and there is more to all of that that you can do to manage or alleviate the pain it will get better, it always does for everyone life will not be constantly low, and in the meantime, try to savor and appreciate even the littlest things that bring you joy, whether it be the cool side of the pillow or a cute gif stay strong i love you ",477

13967,"I really have no idea how to keep going at this point.*I originally posted this in r/depression, but seems more fitting here at this point* 

I'm really not sure where to start here, I honestly never thought I'd reach such a low pathetic point that I'd end up doing this but here we are.
I've hated myself almost entirely for a very long time, but it's just gotten worse of late. I despise everything about myself in every way, I feel completely worthless and worse than that I cannot imagine any future in which I am not consumed by depression and hate. The only thing I had to help me through this was drugs and I've run out with no way to get any more for at least a while and I just don't know if I can make it without them.
I don't sleep until I'm so exhausted I just pass out, because all I can think about is at all times is how I will never be happy, the stupid dreams I have will never come true. Every time I see myself in the mirror it just amplified it all to an absolute maximum, I just see the pathetic ugly fat fuck that I am staring back at me, with no reason to stay alive other than fear of ending it.
All I really want in life, is some degree of financial security, a place to live away from the family that were mentally abusive my entire childhood, and a woman to fall in love with, or more accurately a woman that could actually love me. That last one is really all I've wanted for a long time. It just feels so unattainable, so completely unrealistic that anyone of the opposite sex could ever bare to be near me for any amount of time, or that anyone, full stop, could see anything but a worthless ugly fat loser when they look at me.
This shit just hits me so fucking hard, so fucking often that it just knocks me out. All I can see is the obstacles, I keep climbing and climbing and scrambling for some semblance of sanity, some imitation of 'normality' it eludes me without fail.
I guess, I just can't imagine any possible scenario where I could get any of these simple things, where I could be happy at all for any sustained period of time and when there's nothing but an endless exhausting climb in front of me, I'm not sure I have the energy to climbing when I can look for as far as I can possibly see without an end to this grueling struggle.

8196,"Don't want cause traumasHello, I'm 15 years old girl from Finland, I'm posting here for first time.
That's my story.
It started from 2013, when unknown stranger sent me friend request on facebook, I didn't know it's going to change my life so much...we used to chat sometimes, years changed, we shared numbers to chat and call in whatsapp. Day by day we texted more and more. I fall blindly in love to him, even tho he had his own gf in his country. I got very depressed and anxious, I weren't able to go school etc. so I've missed 8-9 class. Even before I've been anxious of going school but it got worse.
Over year ago, when he broke up with his gf I told about my feelings to him. He accepted to be with me in long distance relationship. (I have never met him even, he lives 7000km away from me and due my age I have no change to go and meet him, he is already +20 but he wont come meet me ""because of his studies"").
We used to text each other daily 2-5 hours, he told he loved me so much he wouldn't be able to live without me, but also he started to force me to do strange shit things, he said he can't be with me if I don't born baby for him, if I don't marry him, like that...he told it's cause of his culture (hes from Tripura)
Then I decided break up with him, I felt so hurt. After sometime he came beg me to be with him, he told I don't need to born baby, I don't need to marry. So this shit continues...
We used to fight for several things and I become more and more anxious and depressed, I've now totally stopped going to school I really can't do anything anymore. I've always been worried will I even have money to go and meet him, I am really poor and I will never get job! I have no future. Yesterday, I blocked him everywhere, I'm never enough for him, he just fakes me, he hate me really I know, I'm so poor kid!!!
And now I just want to die, but I have 10 years old littlebro and I don't know how will be his condition if I kill myself... 
That's what stops me, otherwise I've already had escape from this  hell. Fuck this sounds so stupid and probably none of you can understand. 
Would it cause less traumas for my brother if I started to act rude and make him to hate me first..? 
Then I would be free to kill myself?

9066,"Why ""asking for help"" is not helpful adviceI can't remember how long I have been thinking about suicide. I can can remember a time when this was different, but for many years now those thoughts have been with me, though sometimes just as background noise. The people I have talked to didn't leave (I have read that this is a thing), but everyone (be it in person or on the Internet) keeps telling me to look for professional help. So I have tried; many times i have tried. It is easy to find some social worker or suicide-helpline to listen to you, but after a few tries, what they have to say becomes repetitive. At some point you have heard it all, and sometimes it is not about ""just talking to someone"". A person who doesn't know a suicidal mindset from within can not make the kind of connection that I need at those times; I need to be understood in order to not feel lonely at those times. 
So maybe I should talk to a professional? Even though it takes a lot of effort to get into therapy where I live (hardly any therapist has open slots), I have also tried this. Here I found it very hard to open up at all. I am really bad at talking about my feelings as it is; 1 hour has never sufficed to get even close to any topic that I find difficult to talk about. This time restriction left me with the option to talk about suicidal thoughts in a distant, rational manner (which my therapist found unhealthy). Furthermore I was constantly aware that this is his job. He has to listen to what I want to say, and he is displeased that I do it in a distant rational manner. For me this felt like a conflict. I just couldn't open up to him. When he tried to introduce me to group-therapy (possibly to show me how others talked to him about their feelings) and wouldn't meet with me alone anymore I left therapy (I am even worse at talking in groups). I know I should try again, but while feeling lonely I don't even get out of bed, I don't have the strength to fight for help; it is wrong that people who don't have the strength to live should have the strength to find help. 
I don't know how to get out of my current crisis. So far I haven't told anyone that I feel like this again. I don't want them to worry and/or spent their energy on getting me out of this. I will (yet again) find a way to fight through this alone. And so far, I have found this to work best.

5453,"I'm ""recovered"" but I still feel like I want to cut and tear at myself until there's nothing left. Help.Basic summary: I'm 17, graduated from high school, and spend most of my days at home with nothing but my iPad, cat, and cannabis for company.

I have a sweet boyfriend but we've only been together about a week and I don't feel comfortable using him a pseudo-faux-therapist (yet?). I've cut off my communication with my ex who used to be a bit helpful - I broke up with him for being too controlling and manipulative and I realized this applies to self-esteem and depression as well as everyday shit.

I haven't cut, burnt, or bruised since November 2009 but fuck. I think about it every day - every single time I see a knife or sharp object while I'm alone - I think about it. I think about cutting in places no one would ever notice - on my ribcage near my breasts for example, or on the backs of my thighs - but they seem like cop-outs to me.

I want to do what I used to do - I want to sit at my well-lit, clean desk with my row of tools and slowly and deliberately harm myself on my left forearm, then wash it out and make sure it's clean and safe and forget about them. I used to wear my cuts with pride, I used to wear tank tops in public hours after cutting - what has happened to my courage? Where has my spine gone? Why do I cringe at the mirror?

9715,"Nobody cares Its just too much 
I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I will grow up to be a useless shit, at school I'm a failure. I keep trying as hard as I can but, I just can't pass. Every time I find a way I can possibly go by it fails me, I feel as if every day I'm dragged down more and more theres no way I can catch up. I'm actually among one of the last 100 people that are doing poorly in school. I feel stupid and useless, I'm a complete failure to my family. I don't know why I'm still alive if all I have waiting for me is failure and a shit life. Every time someone asks me how school is going I just any help but feel like crap because the truth is that I'm failing 5 classes out of 7. It's not just my problems with education, my social life is practically nonexistent. I don't have much friends or anything and I doubt any of them give a fuck about me. According to most to my sister (and other people in my family that are my age) it would be better if we weren't seen together because I'm an embarrassment. I know I'm not good looking and I'm freaking fat (20 pounds overweight) so I guess I know why people don't want me around. I feel like I drag people down with me and people see me as a piece of shit on society. I haven't felt happy in a long time, I guess I've felt happy moments but never truly happy. Compared to everyone else I'm nothing I'm just a loser seeking attention. I feel like an attention whore because theres so many people with problems and I'm here asking for sympathy. At home i'll never make my parents proud, I'll always be an embarrassment to my sister and a burden to everyone else. Nobody cares, everyone says its just because I want attention and I want sympathy because I'm pathetic. All I've ever wanted was someone to actually care about me, or not think I'm a piece of shit. I wish I did good in school, but it won't happen. Why do I keep going? 
I feel like a stupid dramatic little girl, because maybe its just a faze, I'm a 16 year old girl and maybe it will pass.
I think if I died, no one would care, there would just be less shit in society.
In the end I serve no purpose to the social organism of humanity and nobody could give a shit about me.

I've about 2 months left from now and I'm just trying my best to spend some time with my mom but I just get annoyed tbh. We both have very different personalities tbh and the relationship hasn't really been the best, atleast from my side but still it's the last moments left and I just want to play games or do some fun stuff at home. Currently I'm in another college(online) temporarily which started like yesterday, and I've already got homework but I try to spend time with her but today she really got me pissed. 

My aunt who KNEW she was COVID positive PURPOSELY shifted between states coz her in-law family didn't want ""covid positive"" tag on their building. And you know what she tells us, ""in our state they lie and purposely give you a covid positive even if you aren't"". The funny thing is she lives in a ultra rich in-laws family who literally went to the BEST hospital in pregnancy for birth and she came here in our state where medical facilities don't even closely match with the top hospitals there. She didn't care if she gave anyone else corona or if she might even be the cause of someone's death. COVID isn't a fucking joke. Her in-laws are very rich and powerful with lot's of black money, they could've hidden the covid positive results easily. She tested positive here and stayed in quarantine here . She even brought her 3year old kid here and left her 8month old kid with her in-laws. Now she's covid negative and got out of quarantine.

 Today my mom was telling me on how she's very sweet for saying, ""don't worry I understand if you(my mom) doesn't want to visit me coz I was COVID positive"" and you see I'm literally going to college to study in MEDICS and I got really annoyed and told her ""well she didn't care about ANYONE when she knew that she was positive and travelled"" and my mom started defending her giving shitty reasons that my aunts told her and I'm just like???? I don't feel like talking to my mom now coz of this. I'm not gonna defend for aunt just cause she's my family. Fuck her for putting others life in danger.

14098,"Not sure what to do anymore.Sorry if this irritates anybody. I don't mean to harm.

I'm a 20-year-old female, currently living in an emotionally and verbally (and past, physically) abusive home. I do not have any money to escape, and my parents badmouth me to any of my relatives. I used to live with my grandparents, but they won't take me in again. Not after what was said about me.

I've been struggling with depression/bipolar disorder since I was 7 years old. My parents would often get frustrated with me when I was quiet and wanted to be alone. I'd get smacked around, pushed, called horrible names, and emotionally manipulated. They were just never happy with me, no matter what I did to try to please them. I wasn't a bad kid -- I didn't steal, I didn't do drugs, I didn't drink. I was just mentally ill.

I was constantly bullied in school for wearing glasses, being slightly overweight, being the top of the class, etc. Whatever they could find a reason to pick on me for, then so be it. It didn't stop with high school, or college. I don't have friends, but I am lucky enough to have a loving, caring boyfriend (S).

I was raped at the age of 14 by my then-boyfriend, D. D was emotionally manipulative, and partook in some...illegal things that I did not condone. It took all of my might to leave, and miraculously, I did. Go me.

I entered a four-year abusive relationship with A. A was physically, verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive. The first two years were alright, but then he decided to show his true colors. I'll spare you the details - but it was bad.

Throughout my teenage and young adult years, I've come to find that self-injury *sorta* helped? The physical pain brought on by the deed seemed to draw away from the emotional pain I was experiencing. When things got very poor, I attempted suicide. Multiple times. Staying in a psychiatric hospital didn't help, but I faked it til I got out, only to experience my emotional pain even worse.

I have nowhere to go to escape my abusive household. I don't have friends. S's parents will not let me stay with them; although we haven't fully explained my situation to them quite yet. My depression is back worse than ever, and it's only being strengthened by the abuse in the household.

I just don't want to leave S behind when I go. He'd be devastated. But I can't continue living in so much pain for so long. 

Again, I'm sorry if this irritated anybody, I wish no harm.

Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.

Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok. I recently told them that I would appreciate it if they wouldn't bring up God anymore and they said if you can't accept him then we have nothing else to say to you. They won't return my calls or text anymore. Now I have no one. I've been laying in bed everyday untill I have to go to work then when I get off I just sleep untill work again.

Well, I'm still alive. My brother found me while I was bleeding out and I've spent the past 2 weeks in inpatient. I got my mess sorted out and I'm feeling a lot better.

******************************



My life has taken many turns up until now. Not the worst you've seen on this sub. Sexual abuse dominated almost my entire high school life. I was afraid of sleep, as hyper realistic nightmares filled my sleep. I was threatened daily with torture and rape. I developed insomnia, depression, and psychosis. I was threatened with being kicked onto the streets if I didn't do whatever he asked of me. Once I got away from him, I was fine for a while. I was still depressed most of the time, but now I had little fits of manic energy, so I brushed it off. I graduated high school thinking it was all over. But then the dreams came back. My psychosis caused me to self harm daily, and I also developed an eating disorder. I attempted suicide for the first time this February. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I went to the psych ward multiple times after this, and in May, I attempted again. 

I've tried recovery, I really have. I wanted so desperately to be better, to be happy. But some people can never reach happiness. Some people just keep going down. I am all alone. All my friends have abandoned me, I'm just a drag to them, even my friend that I went too for everything told me they couldn't help me anymore. I have no one left to talk to. I have only one friend who will still talk to me, but I can tell I'm being a burden. No one can understand. In the end, everyone always leaves me. I won't go back to the psych ward.

12944,"I Have No Other OptionLet's start with some backstory. I was a fantastic student in high school. I had a 4.0 GPA, sang solos in the school musicals, was president of two clubs and helped found two others, and had a very active social life. This was all after I wrestled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout middle school, and I thought I was long past all of it. 

Then, college. I don't really know what happened, but since then I've just had an overwhelming sense of apathy. I barely passed my first quarter, and odds are I'm going to completely fail this one. I wake up and just see no reason to get out of bed. Not a day goes by now when I don't go to any of my classes and end up sleeping for ~16 hours. I don't know why, but I just stopped caring about pretty much anything. If I'm lucky, I'll get enough motivation to actually have two meals in a day instead of one. 

This has just brought back my old depression to even greater levels. Given how competitive they are, I have absolutely no hope of getting into any of my school's science or engineering programs. If I fail this quarter, I'm put on academic probation. My parents know nothing of this and think I'm continuing my straight-A streak. 

I can still easily change my major to one of the guarenteed-admission majors like English or Applied Math or something, but then I have to live the rest of my life knowing that I failed all my lifelong hopes and dreams simply because I didn't feel like it was worth getting out of bed. 

I can't do that. 

I can't live a life where I wake up every day and know that the job I'm working and the life I'm living is a result of a simple lack of motivation. The fact that I've screwed myself over for no good reason just makes me feel worse about myself. It's fucking hopeless. 

Problem is, my apathy worsens my problems, which worsens my depression, which worsens my apathy, which worsens my problems. 
I don't fucking know what to do anymore. I know I should go out, get help, but then, what's the point? I've already screwed myself over. I got lucky enough to get a dorm with a balcony. Not a day goes by now where I don't go out there and imagine jumping. Even stood on the rail once.

5097,"I went from thinking about it to planning it the other night.I figure that's a sign something has got to give, and soon. I won't do it until my dog passes on, but she's not getting any younger.

I'm 35 and I live with extremely debilitating headaches, as well as pain in my neck and shoulders from a damaged disc. The headaches hit me like a truck in 2003, all at once while I was excercising. This type of headache isn't all that uncommon, but they are supposed to go away. Mine never did. I've seen more neurologists than I can count, and been to several specialized headache clinics. The answers are always the same--it should have gone away, no one knows why it hasn't. The rest of the pain is more recent, and I don't want to go onto opioid painkillers, but I will probably have to.

I was a musician. I can still play my acoustic guitar sometimes, but not my electrics as they are too loud and hurt my head. I can't sing like I used to, because singing with any kind of power behind it is, again, extremely painful. I like to think of myself as a writer, but I usually can't concentrate long enough to get anything substantial done.

I live with my parents and work a shitty job because I can't excel at anything too stressful.

I fear relationships because I know I can't support a family, and I know I am difficult to deal with when I'm in pain. People think I'm a flake because social situations are extremely difficult. I have a couple of friends, but they are miserable in their own right and sometimes I don't even want to talk to them.

Perhaps the one person in the world who understands what I'm really going through is my ex girlfriend, but she has attempted suicide several times and I can't talk to her without getting even more depressed. We thought we could be friends, but it's really not working out.

I'm a drain on my parents. Nobody else will really miss me when I'm gone, and they'll be sad but they know how much pain I'm in. I don't want to be in pain anymore. I don't fear death. I don't think life is going to get any better.

I've been telling myself for over a decade that if things didn't get better I'd just end it. I think I'm finally there. What's the point? Why should I keep slogging through this mess?

so in my fancy liberal arts college i was around ppl who were like, 'ah, fuck grad school. grades dont matter' and since i was so obsessed with grades in high school/external reward i didnt conceive of the idea of learning for learnings sake. i also thought maybe someone would rescue me cause they thought i was pretty, and would sort of be this manic pixie dream girl type for guys even tho ive recently realized im gay.

throughout the entirety of college i would ask for extensions on things because i think i saw myself as a really anxious person and part of it was enhanced by myself i think.

14312,"I think I might need some helpI don’t know where else to go to with this.

I’m 26, I’m a newly minted lawyer doing corporate work for the past year. The more I do this, the more I feel that I’m not cut out for this profession. I screw up a lot at work, get yelled at on a daily basis, and work 16 hour days on weekdays, 8 to 12 hours on weekends.

I wake up every morning with a sense of dread. I have to force myself out of bed. Every time I get a work email my heart flutters in a panic. I want to quit so bad, but I have debts to pay off, and I am also saving money to go to grad school. (I’m not from America, law is an undergraduate degree where I’m from.)

I feel like I’m not qualified to do anything else other than practice law, even though it is what’s making me miserable. I feel weak when I speak about this to other people, because everyone else I know, co-workers and law school friends, seems to be coping well with their work. I don’t have time for friends, or my family, and for the past few months the only people I’ve spoken to have been people at work. I feel like I should not be complaining because I get a decent paycheck.

I feel completely worthless and unmotivated to do anything now. I don’t know how to improve my work, but also find that I can’t bring myself to try any more. I lie in bed weekend mornings when I used to rise early to exercise or meet up with friends. I sometimes skip meals because I tell myself that I don’t deserve to eat, and other times because I’m worrying so much about work that I just don’t have the appetite.

I’m also gay, and used to think about suicide as a teenager. Homosexual activity is illegal here, and being gay may cost me my job, and may be grounds for getting me disbarred. When I came out to my friends and family, I got support and acceptance, and was very happy after high school, during my university days. It scares me now that all these thoughts about suicide are coming back to me, and this familiar misery has started to creep back into my life. I thought I was over that and was ready to be happy.

I don’t know how to deal with this. I feel like I’m cracking and I don’t want to. My parents need me right now so I keep telling myself that I have to be strong for them, but I’m also just so exhausted. I would really like some advice on how to deal with this. Thank you.

14436,"Main argument against suicide is so bad it actually has the opposite effectThe main argument against suicide is:

* You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve.

This argument really is the main argument against suicide, as it doesn't apply to people, like the terminally-ill, for whom suicide is considered a viable, acceptable option: euthanasia.

The widespread rationale behind suicide can be summarised like this:

* If you're suicidal and depressed because of a **terminal illness**, your suicide is legitimate and is called **euthanasia**.  
Only physical suffering is real suffering. Only if you're sure to die soon, you can make it quicker and less painful.
* If you're suicidal and depressed for any other reason other than terminal illness, your suicide isn't legitimate.   
You need to stay here for the long haul, and die of ""natural"" death after years of psychological suffering.

When people say ""*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*"" to suicidal, depressed individuals, they can be increasing the chance for the individual to commit suicide. For two reasons:

1. ""*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*"" contains two **fallacies**
   1. [Argument from ignorance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance);
   2. [Appeal to probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_probability).
2. Since ""*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*"" is a trite, hackneyed, fallacious , sound-bite-like argument, it shows **a lack of respect** for the suicidal individual.
   1. For their **intelligence**:  
As if a suicidal individual couldn't intuitively see through a bad argument;
   2. For their **ability to assess** the potential outcomes of their own lives;
   3. For the **value of their life:**  
If you think someone's life really matters, you don't just repeat something that could literarily apply to every single suicidal person.  
""*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve""* just shows you can't see any individuality beyond the potential suicide. That **makes someone who is suicidal feel even more lonely** and therefore likely to commit suicide.
   4. For their **personhood:**  
The idea that suicide isn't a legitimate, valid choice often makes the suicidal person feel like their life doesn't belong to them, but to the community of people/society who cornered them into depression.

This is why I stopped talking about any suicidal ideation to people and therapists.

If I listen to any other ""Life can be beautiful"", ""optimism can pay back"" touchy-feely argument, I'm actually gonna make the jump. It's just disrespectful.

Coaxing someone out of committing suicide requires recognising an individual's right to commit suicide.  
If you delegitimise suicide as a choice, you'll just make the suicidal person feel less empowered, more lonely and devalued.",suicide,"main argument against suicide is so bad it actually has the opposite effectthe main argument against suicide is   you can t be 100 sure your life won t improve  this argument really is the main argument against suicide, as it doesn t apply to people, like the terminally ill, for whom suicide is considered a viable, acceptable option euthanasia  the widespread rationale behind suicide can be summarised like this   if you re suicidal and depressed because of a  terminal illness , your suicide is legitimate and is called  euthanasia   only physical suffering is real suffering only if you re sure to die soon, you can make it quicker and less painful  if you re suicidal and depressed for any other reason other than terminal illness, your suicide isn t legitimate   you need to stay here for the long haul, and die of natural death after years of psychological suffering  when people say  you can t be 100 sure your life won t improve  to suicidal, depressed individuals, they can be increasing the chance for the individual to commit suicide for two reasons  1  you can t be 100 sure your life won t improve  contains two  fallacies   1  argument from ignorance https //simple wikipedia org/wiki/argument from ignorance   2  appeal to probability https //en wikipedia org/wiki/appeal to probability  2 since  you can t be 100 sure your life won t improve  is a trite, hackneyed, fallacious , sound bite like argument, it shows  a lack of respect  for the suicidal individual   1 for their  intelligence   as if a suicidal individual couldn t intuitively see through a bad argument   2 for their  ability to assess  the potential outcomes of their own lives   3 for the  value of their life   if you think someone s life really matters, you don t just repeat something that could literarily apply to every single suicidal person   you can t be 100 sure your life won t improve  just shows you can t see any individuality beyond the potential suicide that  makes someone who is suicidal feel even more lonely  and therefore likely to commit suicide   4 for their  personhood   the idea that suicide isn t a legitimate, valid choice often makes the suicidal person feel like their life doesn t belong to them, but to the community of people/society who cornered them into depression  this is why i stopped talking about any suicidal ideation to people and therapists  if i listen to any other life can be beautiful , optimism can pay back touchy feely argument, i m actually gonna make the jump it s just disrespectful  coaxing someone out of committing suicide requires recognising an individual s right to commit suicide  if you delegitimise suicide as a choice, you ll just make the suicidal person feel less empowered, more lonely and devalued ",467
1613,"I'm beyond hope ugly, so why *shouldn't* I end it?I'm revolting enough that every woman I've ever asked out has gotten angry that someone so ugly would bother. Not beautiful women, but women I thought were plain-looking or somewhat ugly too. One girl went out with me out of sheer pity, but she couldn't bear the ugliness after a few days and broke it off.

Even my mom reminds me of it every time I call. I'm 33, so she shows my headshot to prospective girls and their moms. She relays their extremely hurtful comments to me, and I am starting to think she knows how devastating it is to hear, and *wants* me to off myself. I realize the shame in being the only one of your friends whose son isn't married and has never had a girlfriend at 33. Financially I'm good, am average height, not fat, dress well, but my face, oh god.

Even when I avoid calling home and the awful thoughts start to go away, I'm bombarded with romance in almost every TV show or movie I watch, no matter how male-oriented. I'll be doing fine for weeks and then some love interest on the TV will send my mind into hysterics, never shutting up about dying. I might even just screw up at work, and my mind will just melt into a jumble of never-ending ""boil yourself alive you ugly dumb fuck"" thoughts.

I've tried hobbies, but the ones I've gotten into all involve people, and I can feel the disgust and hate, or sometimes sympathy, people have for me by looking at me - I've dealt with it my whole life, from being punched in the face and pinched as a toddler to being treated extremely coldly by teachers despite being extremely quiet and being top of my class. I even tried religion it's too fucking hard to get into paradise. I'd join my local Freemason Lodge but that involves a lot of speaking and it turns out I'm complete shit at that too.

Honestly the only thing stopping me, and it's quite big, is the work that'd go into it. I don't want anyone cleaning up the mess so it'd have to be in the ocean. And I'd have to clean out my apartment and find a place for everything. But lately I've been caring less about that all and a bottle of some illegal sedatives starts to sound pretty nice.

anyway, i was feeling horrible like 10 mins ago and considering suicide again, unfortunately right now i'm out of cannabis which usually calms me down so it was really rough. I'm feeling a little better now, but i still feel really lost, i really dont know how to ""live""

today i'm starting a new job in sales which im dreading, I hate these jobs, I hate getting hate just because i'm not a native english speaker, call center jobs are miserable, but i literally can't even find a job at mcdonalds, not to mention that over here a lot of the jobs that i would be able to do are restricted to ""female"" like even things that make no sense, like for a candy shop cashier, they only want women working there, and it's the same everywhere.

I need adult friends to coach me on how to like, do things, but of course i'm really bad at making friends and even worse at keeping them so

tl;dr i guess: how do i get a job i don't dread? how do i move to a new city (antigua guatemala)? 

idk what else to ask but if anyone has some time to spare on me, i would like a sort of ""life mentor"" so to speak who can teach me all this stupid adult stuff that i dont know how to do",suicide,"how to live?hello, i m a 28, almost 29 year old, guy i guess, i m transgender but i dont really have any hopes of transitioning, i m not bad looking, i m just a bit overweight, tall, by all accounts i m a decent looking guy anyway basically i dont have any friends, never had, i always hated school, dropped out of highshool twice until i finally managed to graduate when i was 21, one of the reasons i hated school was because they didn t let me have long hair, now at 29 i find not much has changed, i can t hold down a job because the only thing were i can work are call centers, i live in guatemala city btw, honestly i would have liked to work at a hotel, i m good with tourists, and i enjoy interacting with them the problem is that im not allowed to have long hair anywhere i go, and every job that i ve tried to apply to outside of call centers never hires me, i ve been suicidal and depressed for a while, i have been seeing a psychologist and i m on zoloft the only thing that keeps me here and a bit sane is cannabis, which ofc is illegal where i live and bars me from a lot of jobs  anyway, i was feeling horrible like 10 mins ago and considering suicide again, unfortunately right now i m out of cannabis which usually calms me down so it was really rough i m feeling a little better now, but i still feel really lost, i really dont know how to live  today i m starting a new job in sales which im dreading, i hate these jobs, i hate getting hate just because i m not a native english speaker, call center jobs are miserable, but i literally can t even find a job at mcdonalds, not to mention that over here a lot of the jobs that i would be able to do are restricted to female like even things that make no sense, like for a candy shop cashier, they only want women working there, and it s the same everywhere  i need adult friends to coach me on how to like, do things, but of course i m really bad at making friends and even worse at keeping them so tl dr i guess how do i get a job i don t dread? how do i move to a new city antigua guatemala ?  idk what else to ask but if anyone has some time to spare on me, i would like a sort of life mentor so to speak who can teach me all this stupid adult stuff that i dont know how to do",465
8359,"HelpHow do start you this? I was raped a few months ago by my boyfriend of 3 years. Since then, I've been on a slow but steady spiral downwards. A few weeks ago, I was diagnosed with PTSD and put on anti-anxiety medication. But it's not helping. Each week, I hit a lower and lower 'low'. I tried to get help as soon as possible after the rape because I knew some serious shit was brewing inside of me, but it took 2 months for a psychiatrist to even get back to me to confirm an appointment. I tried at least 20 doctors before one finally returned my call. He was the one who diagnosed me, then prescribed me the medicine, and I liked him. But then he didn't even show up for my follow-up appointment, when he said he would try to add-in an SSRI for my mood. Everything else is also falling apart. The few times I have reached out to friends, telling them I was plummeting, they have bailed last-minute or kept pushing it back. I was seeing a counselor at a local rape crisis center, but I just started a new job that doesn't seem very excited that I'll have to take ~1.5 hours per day off to travel to go talk to her. And now, I think HR gossiped about my situation to other people.

I feel so alone and messed up. It feels like this downwards spiral into nothingness is inevitable. I want pain. I want to hurt myself. I already cut my wrist (though not enough to do much damage), had a lot to drink, taken a few benadryls and benzos. I want to burn my home down and hear the flames crackle, feel the heat on my face. I want to stab myself, over and over and over. I want a reason to physically hurt someone and have them hurt me back. I fear that if I had a gun, I wouldn't be here right now.

What do I do? I really need help. I can't believe I am here. I act so happy and outgoing at work, but then I get home and I don't know if I'll be here in the morning. Please help. I feel like I'm trying to walk the wrong way up an endless escalator, and it's taking all my strength to keep walking. But then my legs get tired, and I slip somehow and suddenly find myself plummeting downwards towards this huge, dark pit whose bottom I fear is death. I just want to get back to the top so badly and feel happy again, but it feels impossible.

9298,"There's a bridge near my new house...On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted. 

My head was pounding with a headache, my nose snuffed up, my shoulders hurt, my chest was tight, my back was aching. 

I cried. I cried hard. 

I cried about the rash consuming my legs. I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships. 

I cried about how I assume people think of me. I cried about my job. And my living situation. 

I cried about being different. 

I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk-in clinic. Something I've been putting off for months.

I went downstairs and jumped in the shower. And I sobbed while washing my hair. And screamed and yelled at myself, and the world; not through anger or hate, but because of my inability to change, or more so the self-sabotage that I routinely commit. 

I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror.

I microwaved some chicken fingers, and drank a bottle of water. I watched a YouTube video about a board game. 

And then I cried some more. 

I called the local mental health crisis centre (where I've dragged myself to in the past) because they've called me twice in two weeks, and I haven't returned either of their calls. 

I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now, knowing damn well I might not make it that far. I don't have a doctor, but I know what I do have: and undiagnosed mental illness. Or I'm looking for a crutch. Something to label myself so I know it's not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do.

At this point I was dressed, and ready to leave my house. I put on my sunglasses and headed out, but I didn't head toward the busy main street, or the clinic. I started off toward the bridge. A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current. 

I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge. My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it. The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours. My lungs filling with blood. Cold. Scared. 

But I turned at the last second. Left instead of right. And just walked; for hours. I walked until the road ended, and I was exhausted. 

Then I walked back on the busy main street. 
Watching the people going on with their days. 
Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes, which I had quit two months prior, and a coffee. 

And then I went home.

The thoughts are still there, but I have them in check again.

14566,"I am doneI am trying to put this together, holding back tears. I am 35 years old today, probably half way through the life span I have. I haven't had any problems or difficulties that most other people have. I had a stable family growing up, youngest among siblings. I was bullied by a brother occasionally growing up, but I don't think he meant any harm. My college tuition was taken care of, I have had a well paying job in tech since the last 15 years. I have had a stable job throughout my career, and probably have a million or so in all my investments and savings. I am trying to think of reasons why I hate my life, but I can't come up with any. I haven't had any of the problems that others in this subreddit have experienced. I am probably the exact opposite of some of you, the person that everyone hates.

Yet here I am. I don't really speak to my parents or brothers. It's been years since I have spoken to either one. Today is my birthday, I realized that not a single friend of mine cares. I am sitting in the dark typing this out, while I look at my phone, silent as ever. No one knows I exist, no one wants to go out for a party, and no one wants to wish me a happy birthday. I don't know how I reached here, but I don't have any friends of my own. I haven't been able to hang on to a girl since forever. I don't even know why I am this way. I never used to be this person. I used to have friends, a social circle. I used to laugh, I used to care, I use to be passionate about work. Now, I've hit halfway point of my life, and I can't fucking go through another 35 years of the hell I am right now in. 

Sometimes it's wiser to bow out rather than stretch through eternity in pain. I think I have made up my mind. I don't see any point of living through this. None of you know me, and I know none of you will miss me. Goodbye. It's hard to explain why I am doing this, and I think my parents will be heart broken when they know about it. To anyone reading this after the fact and trying to make sense of what I did, do realize that this was my decision. I've given it thought, I've given it time. This is the only way out for me. I am sorry if I hurt you. I am sorry for everything.

15748,"The TroubleI never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetry  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",suicide,"the troublei never dreamt it could have lasted this long it feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse the corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy  the point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years when the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior i have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind i haven t found an environment for healing, and i don t think i ever will isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if i m truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force  it is a malevolent manifestation of my reality all manner of action speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will none can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable i m but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit  i feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire it only exists when it feels the possibility to arise i feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit i look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetry throughout many smiles from others abound me in my days, and i feel yet obligated to receive this blessing my looks yet deceive my emotion, for i know a disgusted figure is writhing within i cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another i won t let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless  so i reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment if love could break its chains that bind itself to me and i to it it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain society has disillusioned me of the agony i face i am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality  i only wish i had an answer or remedy to this trouble, i fear that none may be found ",465
1889,"Difficult thoughtsSo, I'm in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything. So I guess I'll just post away and hopes it helps a bit.  


So, I had a friend. She commited suicide in 2012, and I got to know only in 2013. I was in my last year of high school when I discovered, and I had a fight with her. Stupid reasons, really. Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn't important. When I tried to talk to her again to apologize, or something, I got the news. It was heartbreaking, and I wish I could have done something, anything. I mean, we were both pretty alone at... life really. And just like that, a person that was one of my only friends was gone, just like that. Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left, that I could never talk to her again. That all I have now is fucking memories.  


So, you'd think, due to my experience, that I'd learn something. I don't know. But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself. I'm not particularly alone, and I KNOW there are people that care. That they are with me, and all that. Still, even when people say that I'm worth it or whatever, I can't seem to believe it. All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing, and how nothing I could ever do would revert that. It's so stupid, but yet, every once in a while, it becomes so heavy and I just don't know what to do. I think that I'm not worth it. That it'd be better if everything came to a stop. But yet, I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care, no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it. Basically, yeah, I don't know. Honestly, I just feel like utter shit, and usually I tank this shit alone, as I've always did. And I see where it takes me. I just wait and see, like the stupid coward I am.  


Anyway, I'm sorry about this. I'm not sure it all made sense, but this is how I'm feeling. this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can't just so something to make it go away. Anyway, I'm sorry if this bothered anyone. I just needed to let this out in a different place, in a place where I don't have the certainty people will just say that I should ""let it go"" already.

5316,I can’t fucking stand my parents politics Idk why I’m writing this I guess to vent fuck grammar fuck this. I live in Kentucky very red and conservative house family friends life. There’s no fucking break. On top of that I have several mental health issues the most of which is depression and self hatred. I don’t wanna fucking see anything I just need to vent. I love my family so so much. And they support trump who I have come to hate so much in the past 6 months with the new awakening to the civil rights movement. I try SO HARD to be civil. To bite my tounge. But trump supporters are crazy. Anywhere you look they’re me maga and fucking cult thinking. I’m sorry if I offend anyone but at the time I’m writing this I don’t fucking care so forgive me please. They can’t see why I’ve changed no matter how many times I state it’s just that I want equality. I want BASIC FUCKING PEACE! They call themselves Christians and to be honest I don’t believe it anymore and somehow I feel more connected to ethical standards. They treat politics like there religion but I’f I confront it my mom says “well I never said we were perfect chosen party were all sinners. My party upholds Christian values” So day what you fucking will about Jesus but he’s a damn good look at how to treat one another. But all of there PoLiTiCs doesn’t fucking support any basic helping of others human beings. IM TIRED OF TRUMP AND IM TIRED OF FOX NEWS AND IM TIRED OF THIS LIFE. It’s so much pain I have tears rn and it could all be better if they weren’t in a litterally fucking hive mind cult. I don’t care about party’s all I want is to help everyone regardless of status. You just gotta be human. That’s it. That’s all. I’ll accept you. But no one around me does. I already am fucking screwed in the head but now I’m living as a minority all because no one around me stood up for the human rights and acts of kindness that they claimed to. I used to be like them but I changed when I saw how they reacted to George Floyd’s death and that of so many others. I’m not here for a fucking lecture on how what to do I’m just here because if I dm didn’t write I’d have no other way to get out my hate and frustration for FUCKING HYPOCRITES FOR RACIST PEOPLE.

6672,"My friend (who is MtF transgender) is very very close to suicide and therapy nor meds don't seem to be helping.She's been suicidal since earlier this year when she (being polyamorous) had 3 of her relationships end simultaneously. Soon after that happened, quarantine began and she, being a person who thrives off frequent social interaction, started feeling worse and worse. 

Myself and her two exes kept talking with her and eventually, after pulling her from jumping, convinced her to seek therapy and medication. It's been hard for her to have consistent therapy because of quarantine and the therapists having tight schedules. She just started a new depression med called Mirtazipine a few weeks ago but that hasn't started helping yet.

She doesn't have a job or health insurance, and has really bad anxiety with dealing with customers, so getting a job that would work well is extremely difficult. She got fired from her last job from missing too many days because of depression. She ended up this month having to move into a boarding house with someone who turned out to be transphobic, and someone else there tested positive for Covid. Her only friend she had there also just tested positive so now she has to be locked away in her room with no physical interaction available.

She is being financially supported by her parents, but only until the end of the year. Her parents historically have been unsupportive of her being transgender, and generally don't help. They are very well off and wanted to invest in real estate that she could move into and pay rent for. They backed out of doing that right before she moved out of her old apartment, but her parents didn't tell her they backed out.

I, at this point and at my wit's end, have suggested that I talk with her parents because she doesn't feel it will help doing it herself. She told me not to mention suicide to her parents because she's worried they will call the police on her and place her on an involuntary hold. She had this done before and it only made everything worse because they treated her like garbage at the facility and she was feeling intense dysphoria without being able to shave at all, and she has terrible PTSD from that situation.

7471,"How to masturbate (for men) You really don't have to masturbate if you don't want to, no actual benefits.

But if you do want to, here is how to do it (can't believe I'm typing this but let's go):

There are 2 methods for male masturbation (there is anal, but I have never done it and I am not knowledged in the slightest about it):

Standing and laying (however, you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing, it's just refering to how they are most commonly performed).

First (for all), find some time to do it.

I suggest getting about 30 minutes of free time.

Then, find someplace where your semen won't be a problem, and **isn't shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with**.

Then, get something to clean it.

A good wipe will do.

You can then find something to do it to.

It doesn't have to be porn or lewd, doesn't even have to be a picture, you can even use your imagination (although keep in mind - it's easy to get distracted).

Then do it in hours when you won't fall asleep during the masturbation (sadly, I am guilty of that one).

Also do it fully naked.

You don't want stains on your clothes.

You can also use a form of lubrication, but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation.

**Now on how to do the standing method:**

Get in a comfortable position, then undress yourself.

Get a grasp of your penis in your palm, and start stroking it.

As gentle, rough or however you feel like.

Don't worry - no harm will be done to your foreskin.

Just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate.

That, really is it all.

**Now on how to do the laying method:**

Undress yourself, and find a soft object.

Then, just rub your penis (or your entire body) on that object until you ejaculate.

Keep in mind that that object WILL get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it.

That's pretty much it.

Now, if you don't know what ejaculation feels like, don't worry, you'll know it when it happens.

If you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like ""fresh out of the penis"", break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid.

Imagine this, but white.

Now, sperm is going to be sticky, smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger (don't ask how I know the last one, and don't attempt to taste it).

And that's it.

Now go on and masturbate.",non-suicide,"how to masturbate for men you really don t have to masturbate if you don t want to, no actual benefits  but if you do want to, here is how to do it can t believe i m typing this but let s go  there are 2 methods for male masturbation there is anal, but i have never done it and i am not knowledged in the slightest about it  standing and laying however, you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing, it s just refering to how they are most commonly performed  first for all , find some time to do it  i suggest getting about 30 minutes of free time  then, find someplace where your semen won t be a problem, and  isn t shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with   then, get something to clean it  a good wipe will do  you can then find something to do it to  it doesn t have to be porn or lewd, doesn t even have to be a picture, you can even use your imagination although keep in mind  it s easy to get distracted  then do it in hours when you won t fall asleep during the masturbation sadly, i am guilty of that one  also do it fully naked  you don t want stains on your clothes  you can also use a form of lubrication, but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation   now on how to do the standing method   get in a comfortable position, then undress yourself  get a grasp of your penis in your palm, and start stroking it  as gentle, rough or however you feel like  don t worry  no harm will be done to your foreskin  just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate  that, really is it all   now on how to do the laying method   undress yourself, and find a soft object  then, just rub your penis or your entire body on that object until you ejaculate  keep in mind that that object will get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it  that s pretty much it  now, if you don t know what ejaculation feels like, don t worry, you ll know it when it happens  if you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like fresh out of the penis , break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid  imagine this, but white  now, sperm is going to be sticky, smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger don t ask how i know the last one, and don t attempt to taste it  and that s it  now go on and masturbate ",462

Then after i sign out he starts going off asking what time i started i told him i was rostered on for the 430-1130pm shift it was already midnight at this point and he starts going on that if i keep finishing early it will be my shifts he cuts back during the slow period.

One of my coworkers has been talking shit behind my back and doing anything he can to try get me in trouble 

And then because i vented to my partner about what had been going on at work she made a facebook post which my older brother saw i got him a job at work because i thought becoming a parent had made him change i wanted to give him the opportunity to make something of his life insteaf of selling drugs for a living he saw the post and took offence to it so now my work environment is even more hostile

11886,"I am not afraid of deathBut I am afraid of what I will miss out on. What if it’s a mistake to kill myself? Most times I am sure that I am committed to my plans. I have several. If one doesn’t work I will move on to the other plan.

TBH I just want all the pain to stop (I suffer chronic pain conditions). I am so tired. I just want to rest but I can’t. There is no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good.

I am happy for weeks at a time, but it always comes crashing back to crippling depression and suicidal ideation. I live for these far and few happy moments, but they seem to be getting farther away.

I don’t want medication. I tried 12 different ones. I’m tired of that game. 

How do you know which one will work for me if you cant even decide on a diagnosis? Why are you trying to push medications that you dont understand how they work on a cluster of symptoms you barely understand? 

They are poison to my body. My body rejects these meds, I am a sensitive person when it comes to chemicals. They tell me to be patient, to wait out the side effects. I think trying 12 meds shows patience. And it’s not like withdrawing from these meds is easy. Have you ever felt brain zaps, like you brain is literally being shocked because you try to focus your eyes? Have you felt anxiety so high that you can’t stay still, and even pacing only slightly helps? Have you had pitting edema, felt like your feet were going to pop like balloons, and you can feel your skin stretch while you watch your ankles disappear? Well I have, and “dealing” with those is not better than “dealing” with suicidal ideation. I will not trade one suffering for another. Thats not how its supposed to work.

This makes me want to give up. What hope do I have left? I tried therapy (DBT) but I don’t buy into that new age crap. It’s all pseudo scientific bullshit. Sure, studies show it helps over 70% of patients, but I am not a statistic, I am not everyone else. I am not a cookie cutter type of patient.

I just want to die, but apparently I am not allowed to. And I’ll be damned if I get stuck in a hospital again. All they do is pump you with poison. There is no counselling. No therapy. Just other sick people to talk to.

5472,"I honestly have nothing to live forI’m still in Uni but so far behind. I’m supposed to be graduating this year but I only completed half my credits. I decided to take a gap semester. Ive been so down and demotivated for a couple of years now. Nothing excites or interests me. I have no motivation for anything in life, no hobbies no interests no passion. It’s sad. I barely made friends at uni and when I did I pushed them all away because I feel like socializing is exhausting and I’d rather be alone. I’ve pushed everyone away from my life. I only had my partner left but he broke up with me 2 weeks ago. Apparently I was too jealous... I was never jealous at the beginning of our relationship (we never labeled it so idk what it was but we spent all the time together doing everything together) and I trusted him with everything until I found out he was sleeping with other girls behind my back . I never told him I knew but that’s when I started getting jealous and paranoid which I guess pushed him away. He was also on tinder on and off and I confronted him about it but he said he doesn’t use it and the app is just there which wasn’t true. I know I deserve better because why would I stay with someone who was constantly cheating on me. But why would he tell other people that I was jealous and it was too tiring and exhausting for him... It truly broke my heart when he ended things with me because I was loosing 2 things at once. My lover and best friend and that hurt so much. He really meant so much to me and he still does. But I know he doesn’t feel the same way about me. The same day he broke up with me he started seeing other girls and going on dates. It made me feel like ass because of how quick he moved on. It just felt unfair. It made me hit complete rock bottom. I was already down before that because I was stressed and had some family problems going on and I guess my anxiety and depression. I didn’t know how to mourn or begin to recover. I just kept thinking how much I really don’t want to be alive or here today. For many months I’ve had these thoughts that I don’t want to be alive that I don’t see a future for myself that I just want to die and now I truly want that.

7543,"never been this at risk, I’m scared.I struggled a lot throughout my life, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt this scared for myself. I genuinely am at risk for taking my own life. I am in a house that has an abundance of medication, and we have guns and ammunition. I don’t know how much longer I can withstand these feelings.

I’m 18 and behind a year in school. I dropped out for a period of time because my mental health was so bad I thought my old friends were plotting against me so that I would die. That followed a rough break up. 

I still care a lot for my ex, and he is my “fp”. I have BPD traits, but most are under control. 

I was doing somewhat okay, even with the stress of wanting to build a friendship with my ex and that heartbreak, but things suddenly came to a huge halt.

My emotional support animal who I did everything with suddenly passed after an emergency surgery attempt, we didn’t even know what was going on. He had a fatal mutation of a virus and couldn’t be saved. This happened October 20

Since then things have gotten worse. I talked to my ex that night and he was supportive, but I didn’t talk to him again since as I knew he had exams and didn’t want to get in the way. I can barely function without my cat and I’ve become severely depressed. I’ve been binge eating constantly and that just makes me want to die even more (I have anorexia). I live with my family and they’re putting immense pressure on me to function and go to school and do all this homework and I just can’t function. Not only that, I’m extremely sore right now from my scoliosis and I’m pretty sure my period is starting.

I got ignored by my ex over text after wishing him a happy Halloween and asking him about exams. He frequently breaks his phone so I sent it over Instagram and got left on seen. I am grasping at threads in order to find a reason to live, but things are genuinely so bad and rarely in my entire life have I ever caught a break. 

I’m thinking about admitting myself to hospital but I don’t want to be cooped up and I don’t even know if I want to live so it’s kinda like what’s the point. On the other hand I’m afraid, and I genuinely feel I might do something.

I feel like I have a million problems I can’t fix and I’m drowning in school work, and I genuinely don’t think I want to continue living. I don’t know what to do.

2838,"Fuck this shit. I'm finally done.I'm ending it. I've been going through bullshit day in and day out every single motherfucking day of my life.

I cry every morning when I wake up, I cry during the day if I can find a place to be alone, and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I don't have any friends. I haven't had any friends for over a year. I am sociable, but people don't want to hang out with me.

My mom is verbally and psychologically abusive. My job hates me and threatens to fire me all the time. Then I would have bills to pay that I couldn't pay. I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

I was trying to make brownies earlier, and I spilled a little bit of chocolate on the counter. Maybe the size of a quarter. My mom went ape-shit telling me how I need to take a cooking class and calling me a ""fucking retard"" and saying, ""What did I do to deserve you as a child?"" that there's ""chocolate everywhere; all over the counter, paper towels, in the sink"" and none of this bullshit is fucking true. I am a neat freak. I'm not a slob.

I always try to not let it bother me, but fuck, it fucking bothers me enough that I've decided to end my life. If she hears me crying she says ""fuck you"" and if I continue to cry she takes my car keys away (by force, I will fight her) and take my cell phone away and probably try to choke me which she has done before.

I'm 19 years old and I already feel too old for this. I am so tired that I feel like I'm 90. I'm tearing up and so afraid to cry that it's making it harder to hold it in.

I always kinda felt bad about thinking about killing myself by thinking my family would miss me. Maybe they will, and maybe my mom will be miserable forever but now that is what I *want*. My mom always tells my family members that I am a horrible person. That I lie and steal, and that I do horrible things that I have never done in my life.

6444,"I'm slipping and I'm afraid.Part of me wants to live. Part of me wants to fight. Part of me sees my potential and wants to strive to reach it.

But I've been slipping further towards my death. I've made attempts in the past. Overdoses, mainly. It was a surprise when I survived each time. I was content as I shut my eyes and waited for things to end. My most recent overdose, I was nearly sure it'd be fatal, as it wasn't a spontaneous attempt and I had done quite a bit of research. I'm still not sure how I survived.

I feel like another attempt is building up. I've been making arrangements for it and sometimes, like as I write this, I'm afraid. I feel like it's going to happen and my plans this time are with a method that would only fail if there's a miracle. 10 seconds of intent and I'm unconscious, with being a vegetable in less than 10 minutes, and being dead in less than 10 more minutes. If I can make it through those 10 seconds, without backing out, I'll die unless someone interrupts me. I'm not rushing into this, so I'm pretty sure I'd be able to guarantee my privacy.

I'm intelligent, generally pretty kind, decently attractive, and good at almost anything I put my mind to, but sometimes I just can't see any hope. It doesn't help that my depression and anxiety issues have manifested into pretty severe agoraphobia either. Sometimes, I wish I could just go get therapy, but I can't even manage the go part, except on rare occasions.

There's only one person I know that I have enough rapport built up with, that I really feel like I can talk to, and they went full non communication weeks ago. They told me it was for my benefit too, acting like it would help me. Having a friend that I trusted was what was helping me though. Having someone to play online games with and talk to, was helping me. Always losing everyone I feel close to, doesn't help.

I feel like a prisoner, stuck in a cell of my own making. I want to escape. I want to find love. I want to have children someday and try to give them all the happiness I couldn't find for myself.

15143,"I'm on my last legOn May 11th, I found out that a singer from a band I loved for almost a decade died by his own hand. He jumped off the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland; the same bridge he sang about jumping off of about a decade ago in the song 'Floating in the Forth.' His name was Scott Hutchison and he sang and played guitar for the band Frightened Rabbit (and several other bands/projects, look him up if you'd like). This was the triggering event for me to begin spiraling downward into the abyss. I became obsessed with reading about him and watching old interviews. Especially the one from just two months before his suicide.

Happiness is a brief affair and does little to fill the emptiness inside me. I went to group therapy for three weeks. It didn't do much to comfort me, in fact, I learned that instead of being Bipolar, I have Borderline Personality Disorder (or maybe both). I've been reading up on it and realized how truly fucked I am. I had only two days in the last 3 or so months where I didn't want to die. Those two days were before I had my heart broken again.

 I thought I found someone who saw through the darkness eating away at me. Past my ugly face with the pockmarks and acne scars, the frown lines, and my general aura of negativity. I thought they saw something good in me that I couldn't and I held on until I felt emotionally stable enough to tell them how I feel.

It was a mistake.

They told me they loved me like a \[sibling\] and it crushed me. That they didn't want me to ruin our friendship. I thought they looked at me the way I looked at them. That their smiles at me were out of some level of romantic love. That I might be able to find some level of comfort amid the endless torrents of pain.

The medicine isn't working. Therapy isn't helping. I'm angry or sad or depressed all the time. Nothing is fun anymore. I barely sleep and eating is just a chore. Sleeping is just a way to pass the time

I'm being held hostage in my own body and I can't help but wonder what is on the other side. Is it nothing? Or will I see my father again and have to apologize for being the first one to see him there?

There's still a part of me that wants to live but it is slowly being snuffed out.

2828,"Life feels so overwhelming...Hello 

I don't even know where to start, but right now, things are really bad - or feel really bad at least. I'm aware that a lot of it has to do with how I experience it and I think this might make it worse. 

Right now, I have a week off annual leave that I've been looking forward to for months. But now we're in full lockdown again and even though I don't want to go outside (thanks to OCD), it just frustrates me that I don't really have too many options - no cinema, no restaurant visits... I understand it's necessary, but it's still hard. 

I have no family or friends nearby either. Just housemates that I don't get along with very well. Or rather, that I don't really want to talk to as that would drag me down even more.

I have a therapist, but I feel that the quality of therapy just gets worse and worse, we don't really resolve anything, we just chat. Which is nice, in a way, but it doesn't really help in the long run. She told me to contact her whenever I need to get something off my chest, but she doesn't really reply to it anymore, which kind of defies the purpose. 
I know that most therapists probably wouldn't be available 24/7, and that's understandable - but I do miss those replies she used to send, a short text or voice message, sometimes giving advice or even just to acknowledge it. 

She pretty much is the only person I can talk to. My family would just tell me to get my stuff together. 

I do have a best friend, but she seems very distant recently too. Maybe it's the situation as a whole, maybe some external factor, maybe I'm just such a pain? I can't even ask that as I'd be worried she would just sugarcoat  the answer (Or start to feel annoyed if I keep asking why she's so distant/if she still wants to go on holidays once it's safe to do so).

I think the only reason I'm still here is that I know deep inside that I mean... at least something to some people. Probably not as much as I wish I would, but that's something I only have so much control over. I try my best, but I can't tell what other people are thinking. 
(Well. And because I just got that off my chest)

Alright. Thank you for reading!

7079,"bye everybody no mining to live any more Hey all. I'm going to try to be as brief and honest as I can.

I'm 17, male from swedan. I wanted to work in IT my whole life. I did an IT course last year and really disliked it, now I hate the thought of IT/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job. I quit my job in retail half way through last year, I was only working casually for some money but I had come to really, really hate it. I hated the idea of working, and I had nothing in mind for a job. In fact, I couldn't even IMAGINE a job where I would want to get out of bed and go to work, and I still can't to this day.

I started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression. It didn't do much. I upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg. This helped with anxiety, but I still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide. I tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things. Nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if I could play video games all day as a life I wouldn't be able to do it.

I'm going to be done pretty soon. I currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because I'm a student, and I have money to spend. My life is actually very great at the moment, yet I still want to commit suicide, because I'd rather feel nothing than feel negative (doesn't this seem obvious?) When school ends (in a few weeks) my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni. I am definitely not going to work, I'd rather die. I'm not going to go to uni with a student loan because I don't want to go through with it in the first place and I'm not going to force someone (the cosigner) to pay the loan back when I drop out or whatever.

So what are my options? Tolerate a life I hate or end my life. I think the answer is pretty obvious. I'm done with looking for things to improve my life, as I really doubt it's going to happen. I'm going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life.

I'm going to sleep now so I want respond in this thread for many hours. i'm going to take my life",suicide,"bye everybody no mining to live any more hey all i m going to try to be as brief and honest as i can  i m 17, male from swedan i wanted to work in it my whole life i did an it course last year and really disliked it, now i hate the thought of it/computer related things as a hobby, or as a job i quit my job in retail half way through last year, i was only working casually for some money but i had come to really, really hate it i hated the idea of working, and i had nothing in mind for a job in fact, i couldn t even imagine a job where i would want to get out of bed and go to work, and i still can t to this day  i started taking 50mg zoloft 10 months ago for anxiety/depression it didn t do much i upped the dosage to 100mg and then to 150mg this helped with anxiety, but i still had exactly the same feelings towards my future and committing suicide i tried picking up new hobbies, finding new interests and doing new things nothing is interesting enough to make me want to live for it, and even if i could play video games all day as a life i wouldn t be able to do it  i m going to be done pretty soon i currently have a tolerable life as my mum lets me live with her because i m a student, and i have money to spend my life is actually very great at the moment, yet i still want to commit suicide, because i d rather feel nothing than feel negative doesn t this seem obvious? when school ends in a few weeks my mum will expect me to get a job or work towards uni i am definitely not going to work, i d rather die i m not going to go to uni with a student loan because i don t want to go through with it in the first place and i m not going to force someone the cosigner to pay the loan back when i drop out or whatever  so what are my options? tolerate a life i hate or end my life i think the answer is pretty obvious i m done with looking for things to improve my life, as i really doubt it s going to happen i m going to stop taking my zoloft cold turkey, which will make me feel awful and give me the courage to take my life  i m going to sleep now so i want respond in this thread for many hours i m going to take my life",458
12665,"Need advice pleaseThis is the fourth time rewriting this. Sorry if it gets long.

I wrote notes to my two best friends, a gorgeous and kind person who’s totally selfless and everyone loves her, and a person who always makes me feel so valid and who I can laugh with and relate to on so many levels who’s so proud of themselves and I can’t help but be proud of them too. My older brother who relies on me to fix all his problems because he has a guilty conscious and thinks he’s bad, my favorite cousin who’s like a sister to me and who I want to have all my books, and my little cousin who I love so much, she’s my little buddy and I’ll miss her a lot. Also my childhood best friend because I feel like I have to even though our relationship at this point is pretty one sided.

I still have to write to my parents and my principal. Im not close with her, I just want to let her know that I wasn’t bullied and it wasn’t because of anyone at the school. It kind of is about kids at school, but not bullying. They just dont really acknowledge me anymore. I’m never anyone’s first choice. Even my best friends have other best friends they love and know better than me. It sucks.

I started rambling, sorry. I’m also writing one to my therapist just to say it’s not her fault and she shouldn’t feel like she could’ve helped me, because I didn’t give her a chance to. She doesn’t think I’m suicidal anymore, she doesn’t know I started cutting again. When we first met I had started my clean streak. I was at seven months when I relasped. I feel worthless because of that. Among other things.

She’ll tell my mom if I open up to her about these things, so right now we just talk about my loneliness and my depression and anxiety. She’s bringing me some papers from her hospital at our next session about making friends to try and help me. She’s trying her best.

I guess I what I asking is what do I write to my parents? I plan on doing it sometime in November so I need to have them done soon so I can focus on other things until then. I want them to be hadnwritten even though typing is way faster and easier so they’ll feel like they have a part of me I guess. Anyone have any tips on what to say?

Currently, I’m single and work at a gas station while attending community college, I live with my parents and older brother, attending university, which I will also attend next semester, should I live long enough to do so. I was born with some knots in my umbilical cord, so I think I was supposed to be born dead, but I guess that wasn’t going to happen. I moved when I was 5, in my new place I made both friends and enemies, I was humiliated by my peers, for the most part. I moved again at 11 and sought to reinvent my image, I just wanted a girlfriend, but I ended up making lots of friends and then I lost them all junior year, they take some jokes too far, and sometimes so do I. Friends, you see, are valuable, they keep you from being alone, but not like sex, not like intimacy, so I cast the idea of friends aside for time constraints. I tried parties, and even went to a bar, it was awful, I was disgusted by the environment and the people. I don’t like solicitors, and I won’t pay for sex, it shouldn’t have to be expensive, or a rarity, it’s natural, and people like it, I don’t like this society that dehumanizes sexual activity as objectifying women, all sex isn’t rape, and rape is just a lack of control, I’m pretty sure duck sexual selection runs on rape, and don’t get me started on dolphins. But it’s not even sex, see ever since I was 7 and watched women’s wrestling, I developed a mild pygophilia, my cousin threatened to sit on my face, and I tried to taunt her into doing it, but she wasn’t very aggressive about it. Face-sitting and ass-worship have come to make up most of my thoughts, I’ve tried 10 times to get closer to women since then, and I haven’t managed to get anywhere, I got stood up at prom, ignored after homecoming, twitter shamed, shamed by my friends, and exiled from all cliques. I have wasted my life, I just want to satisfy my pygophilia, but it seems that this will never be the case, not with someone like me. I tried prostitution before, Craigslist, r/randomactsofmuffdive, and they are either bots, or ugly, well I don’t believe I deserve this treatment, and I did not ask to live a life like this, I simply had faith that people would understand, life, can’t always be made the best of, not for broken people, I don’t think I can be fixed to function in society.",suicide,"i think i lostim 18, im a guy, and i regret my life, the likes of which were wasted on me currently, im single and work at a gas station while attending community college, i live with my parents and older brother, attending university, which i will also attend next semester, should i live long enough to do so i was born with some knots in my umbilical cord, so i think i was supposed to be born dead, but i guess that wasnt going to happen i moved when i was 5, in my new place i made both friends and enemies, i was humiliated by my peers, for the most part i moved again at 11 and sought to reinvent my image, i just wanted a girlfriend, but i ended up making lots of friends and then i lost them all junior year, they take some jokes too far, and sometimes so do i friends, you see, are valuable, they keep you from being alone, but not like sex, not like intimacy, so i cast the idea of friends aside for time constraints i tried parties, and even went to a bar, it was awful, i was disgusted by the environment and the people i dont like solicitors, and i wont pay for sex, it shouldnt have to be expensive, or a rarity, its natural, and people like it, i dont like this society that dehumanizes sexual activity as objectifying women, all sex isnt rape, and rape is just a lack of control, im pretty sure duck sexual selection runs on rape, and dont get me started on dolphins but its not even sex, see ever since i was 7 and watched womens wrestling, i developed a mild pygophilia, my cousin threatened to sit on my face, and i tried to taunt her into doing it, but she wasnt very aggressive about it face sitting and ass worship have come to make up most of my thoughts, ive tried 10 times to get closer to women since then, and i havent managed to get anywhere, i got stood up at prom, ignored after homecoming, twitter shamed, shamed by my friends, and exiled from all cliques i have wasted my life, i just want to satisfy my pygophilia, but it seems that this will never be the case, not with someone like me i tried prostitution before, craigslist, r/randomactsofmuffdive, and they are either bots, or ugly, well i dont believe i deserve this treatment, and i did not ask to live a life like this, i simply had faith that people would understand, life, cant always be made the best of, not for broken people, i dont think i can be fixed to function in society ",457
2122,"My mom “cant take it anymore”. Neither can I.I’ve been depressed and anxious for most of my life. My parents haven’t helped. They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now I’m just annoying to them. I’ve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (I’m talking fucking years dude) and I’m experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I can’t hold down a job, I’m living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isn’t helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. I’m terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I can’t feel anything. I’m either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. I’m back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing I’ve been looking forward to for months, the only thing I’ve been trying to live for I can’t go to anymore. I’m a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. I’m better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. I’d been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had weren’t right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldn’t take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so I’m just alone. They won’t even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again.

8143,"Considering being stupid tomorrow and just having this all be over withI don't want to talk about anything in detail regarding my past or my issues now. To be brief, self hatred is the issue and its very strong. I totally understand that my thinking is really distorted and wrong and full of cognitive errors, but it doesnt matter, I just want to hate myself and not get better. 

I keep getting close and thinking that I should call out for help one last time, maybe there is something missing that I havent considered. And to no one elses fault, people try to help but really nothing can help me when all thats on my mind is how disgusting and evil I am and how I want to hate and hurt myself and the reality doesnt matter. 

Frankly, whats pushing me over the edge is the fact that my future is the isolation and self hatred now but worse and the fact that I am frustrayed and give up. Nothing is working and I have tried a lot. Every way I try to look at life, I still end up so ashamed and guilted and angry at the hunk of shite I am. 

I havr been waiting and waiting so long. I guess the day to finally do it is whenever I have grown tired of failing and hurting and being what I am. That day was long ago, I fucking give up, I will never be better. I am so fucked in the head, I make no sense, I understand and know nothing, I'm a moron with nothing to be proud of. 

If I attempt, I cannot fail because it will permanently destroy my life and relationship with family and the logistics of work and school. Luckily its hard to fuck up with a shotgun. Suicide is stupid because I destroy the family I love, I cant predict the future and I permanently am over. But I am so frustrated with it all, I want it to be over and don't care if its the dumbest decision ever or even if it destroys my family. 

What else can I wait for? No one can save me and I am not saving myself. I cant try, no one can fix me for me. I have tried it all, I'm just a pathetic moron making problems for myself when I should have none. I don't think there is any answer out there or solution. Theres a good chance I feel better tomorrow and not do it. But eventually at this rate, I will. I need to get angry enough at myself for the courage to drive out, get drunk and do it.

I looked around the house last night but we don't really have any means available. I have a backpack I can fill with rocks; the river is about a mile from where I live. I ran through what time people wouldn't be around the piers. I don't care if drowning if painful. It cant hurt worse than this noise in my head and what does it even matter if it hurts anyway? I hope I suffer in the end. I hope its painful. I'd be leaving behind two young kids, friends, a husband. I deserve to suffer. I hope when I do it I regret it and suffer horribly for those few minutes.  I love everyone so much. I love my friends, Im so sorry I am losing this fight. They are such nice, kind people. I'm sorry. I KNOW this is irrational. I even have an appointment set up to get help, but I am beside myself with this feeling that I don't deserve anything. I dont think I'll make it. I feel like I am at war with my own mind. My whole chest hurts with this feeling. I don't want to burden my friends, but at the same time I feel like a big hug and someone just saying ""don't give up please"" would get me a little strength. Isn't that selfish? I think things like that and I just feel worse. I'm always the one to cheer everyone up, to check on everyone make sure their feeling all right. I just send little texts to say hi!

I have spent my whole life just letting shitty people do shitty things to me because Im too scared or feel guilty for asking for even asking for a goddamned hug from my own friends.

1796,"I think I just made suicidal gesture?Okay, 

So I'm in grad school and it really sucks. I'm really not into the idea of going into academia, but I don't want to quit, I love my discipline and, let's be real, I have nothing else going for me. That said, I can't stand my peers or the faculty, I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost.
I got into a language program that would be great for my CV, but financially speaking, I just can't afford to support myself through the summer. Outside of loans I'm on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left. I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don't do this, I will not get my degree. My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning.
I have no clue what to do. I don't want to give up my degree, but I really, really HATE my program. If I stay, I'll be miserable, if I go, I'll hate myself for quitting. I know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done. 
Last night, I got into a really big argument with my parents. It wasn't so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself. A few hours later, after I got done studying, I was really upset.  I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it. So, I took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there. I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either I didn't think it would work or I chickened out. I don't really know which it was. I took it off and just went to bed.
So, I guess my question is, did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it? I don't want my parents to worry about me/I don't want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation. But, I also don't think  this is something I should brush under the rug.",suicide,"i think i just made suicidal gesture?okay,  so i m in grad school and it really sucks i m really not into the idea of going into academia, but i don t want to quit, i love my discipline and, let s be real, i have nothing else going for me that said, i can t stand my peers or the faculty, i feel like an idiot most of the time and i cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further, given the cost i got into a language program that would be great for my cv, but financially speaking, i just can t afford to support myself through the summer outside of loans i m on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money i have left i tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if i don t do this, i will not get my degree my adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning i have no clue what to do i don t want to give up my degree, but i really, really hate my program if i stay, i ll be miserable, if i go, i ll hate myself for quitting i know what your thinking, but transferring in grad school is easier said than done  last night, i got into a really big argument with my parents it wasn t so much about what decision i was going to make and more about the fact that i need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself a few hours later, after i got done studying, i was really upset  i was thinking that i had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it so, i took my belt off, fastened it around my neck, tied it to a rack in my closet, not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there i considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head, but either i didn t think it would work or i chickened out i don t really know which it was i took it off and just went to bed so, i guess my question is, did i just make a suicidal gesture and what should i do about it? i don t want my parents to worry about me/i don t want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation but, i also don t think this is something i should brush under the rug ",455
5418,"Failed university, thinking of throwing in the towel on life altogetherI've been pursuing a bachelor's degree for four years now and I just found out I failed 3 classes this semester which means my financial aid will be terminated. Without it I can't afford tuition, I have no idea how I'm going to break this to my parents. This was not suppose to happen, I was suppose to graduate this spring and find a decent job with a decent wage that would motivate me to pursue professional help to confront my avoidant personality disorder and possibly move out of my parents home. I was so so close. sigh. University was really the only thing I had going for me, it was the only redeeming aspect of my life. I have no friends, no significant other, most people would probably consider my lifestyle boring (I read books, browse the internet, workout, attend university while making sure to always keep to myself) i'm basically a hermit, I would only venture out of my house to attend classes or the gym. I guess the thing that bothers me the most (aside from fucking up my future) is that I know why I failed, it's a mixture of a lot of things, really. I was studying a major a didn't care for that had lousy job prospects, worse part is I chose it. I chose it because it required very little math, my brain doesn't work well with numbers so my choices were very limited to begin with. Some of my peers dropped out after the first year but I kept going (passing by doing the absolute bare minimum, C's get degrees right?) I continued despite feeling deeply dissatisfied because my whole life I was conditioned to go to college and obtain a higher education, there's a stigma attached to those people who take alternative avenues. I'm already judged enough by the abnormal life I lead, really didn't need to add another thing to the mix. Do any of you guys have any advice? I have no idea where to go from here. Once the anger wears off my parents are probably going to demand I get a job and contribute with expenses which is totally understandable. If I was a healthy functional adult I would comply without hesitation, but I can't even imagine myself going through the whole interview process much less sustaining a job. All I know is how to be a student (I suppose not even that). I'm filled with absolute apprehension when I contemplate my future. I'm 21 soon to be 22 and I have nothing to show for.

8356,"I am Scared I Might Kill MyselfI really don't know the correct way to phrase this but I have been suffering from Major Clinical Depression for about 5 years. About 4 years I began counseling which ended about a year ago. I tried pills and I tried therapy. The pills never worked no matter how many different ones I tried. I self harmed for 4 years, I have not self harmed (outside of an attempt) since March 2018. I attempted suicide 3 times total over the period of my counseling and 1 time (a week ago) since it has ceased.

The deal is, I have no planned suicide attempts. Every attempt I make is solely on impluse. I am constantly depressed all day everyday. I can only ever think of how sad I am. Yeah good things happen every now and then but they dont make me ""Happy"".

Well, ever since therapy ceased I have developed basically what is a ""fear"" of death. I guess we spent so much time talking about how terrible it is and how it will hurt everyone I know I'm hard wired to be fearful of it. Before it was easy, I could slice a chunk of skin out my arm or even burn myself without much of a second thought.

Well my latest suicide attempt has me broken, I couldn't really ""hurt"" myself and in return im stuck in this state. I dont want to live, and i don't want to die. I cant find anyone who understands this. The feeling of being here when you dont want to and just not knowing how to cope.

 At the same time, when I am neutral depressed like I am now, I worry that I will become triggered again which sends me into a spiral of non stop panic attacks, tears, and grabbing the closest thing to me to try and just make it all stop. 

I dont want to feel that feeling, because being suicidal now feels a lot different than it felt a few years ago when I was just getting started with the counseling. Being suicidal now messes me up. It messes me up that when I impulse try to kill myself and don't succeed everything that comes after mentally just breaks me. 

I already feel like crap all the time, but I never know when something will trigger me to go into an episode. I dont like feeling like that and I'm afraid it will happen again soon.

Im sorry for the wall of text, just no one i know understands when i try to explain it to him and because of my other medical expenses I cant afford therapy anymore.",suicide,"i am scared i might kill myselfi really don t know the correct way to phrase this but i have been suffering from major clinical depression for about 5 years about 4 years i began counseling which ended about a year ago i tried pills and i tried therapy the pills never worked no matter how many different ones i tried i self harmed for 4 years, i have not self harmed outside of an attempt since march 2018 i attempted suicide 3 times total over the period of my counseling and 1 time a week ago since it has ceased  the deal is, i have no planned suicide attempts every attempt i make is solely on impluse i am constantly depressed all day everyday i can only ever think of how sad i am yeah good things happen every now and then but they dont make me happy  well, ever since therapy ceased i have developed basically what is a fear of death i guess we spent so much time talking about how terrible it is and how it will hurt everyone i know i m hard wired to be fearful of it before it was easy, i could slice a chunk of skin out my arm or even burn myself without much of a second thought  well my latest suicide attempt has me broken, i couldn t really hurt myself and in return im stuck in this state i dont want to live, and i don t want to die i cant find anyone who understands this the feeling of being here when you dont want to and just not knowing how to cope  at the same time, when i am neutral depressed like i am now, i worry that i will become triggered again which sends me into a spiral of non stop panic attacks, tears, and grabbing the closest thing to me to try and just make it all stop  i dont want to feel that feeling, because being suicidal now feels a lot different than it felt a few years ago when i was just getting started with the counseling being suicidal now messes me up it messes me up that when i impulse try to kill myself and don t succeed everything that comes after mentally just breaks me  i already feel like crap all the time, but i never know when something will trigger me to go into an episode i dont like feeling like that and i m afraid it will happen again soon  im sorry for the wall of text, just no one i know understands when i try to explain it to him and because of my other medical expenses i cant afford therapy anymore ",455

The thought of going back makes me so enraged and anxious that words can't express it. I hate the city it's in, I hate everyone I've met, I hate it all. It's all been shit but I did it so I would get a degree because that's what my mom's always wanted and my fuck up sister dropped out after partying for a year at a ~50k a year university. So I picked the most prestigious public school in my state and footed the bill myself so my mom wouldn't see her efforts go entirely to waste.

I fucking hate everything right now. I'm just full of anger and I have no one to talk to because everyone would rather me continue on this way for their own comfort, even when it makes me miserable.

And then after I stay here for a week I'm spending a week with my sister, and she's ~soooo excited, but I know it's gonna turn into the (sister's name) show real fucking quick and I'm sick of sitting around listening to everyone else talk about themselves and not being able to get a word in edge wise.

I'm new to reddit, but I've been lurking for the past few months, but I wanted to post here because I just don't know anymore. I want people, even if strangers, to know my story.

My whole life has just been a lieu of pain. Childhood emotional abuse and mental abuse was at ever corner. Cops constantly visited my school to get me to go home with my mother at the end of day when I didn't want to. Middle school, high school, you name it. Left alone all the time so my social life was fucked from the beginning. Even after my parents divorce and my dad finally getting custody of me, the pain still didn't end. I was constantly put in a position of ridicule for not being into sports or something ""normal"". 

The one time I showed and displayed suicidal ideation, my father chucked my personal computer, that I paid for on my own, against the wall telling me I'm stupid and that I belong with all the other ""retarded"" patients in a mental hospital. I didn't want to go to hospital. So I've never been hospitalized.

I wish I was. I hate myself. I hate myself. I'm not good enough for anyone. I'm not great.

Recently my ""best"" friend pushed me out, and now she's just mean to me. I've done nothing to her. Now she's my ""ex"" friend. I feel forsaken. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't have many friends at all. 

I just want to end it all today. I don't care anymore. The consequences I couldn't care less about. I'm just a college student with nothing going for them. My grades are falling. My love life is going to shit. My friends are leaving me. I want to isolate and die. 

I want to END it. I want this pain to go away. I want my friends to leave. I want my parents out. I don't care about funeral costs, I don't care about how other people feel. I don't really care. I won't ever get into medical school. I'll never be a psychiatrist. I'll never be a counselor. I'm nothing. I'm fucking ugly. All I fucking do is play Overwatch all day and hope I feel something.

If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't. I really loathe going to college where I end up just browsing the internet on my laptop until it's time to go home. I am such an asshole jerk, you don't need to tell me. I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off.

I used to like my job but I quickly began to hate it with a passion just like I do everything else. I can't find anything that I'm passionate about. The only thing I want anymore is a relationship but I've been in love with the same girl for over 10 years and I can't shake these feelings. She isn't attracted to me and has been in a relation for 5 years but for some reason I can't get over her. And anytime I try to meet someone new it never works out. I can't get past the talking stages. I've never even been on a date or kissed anyone and I'm 20 years old, I wouldn't care if it was my choice but it's not. The only thing I crave anymore is the touch of another human. I've started banging my head against things, this world feels like a nightmare. I can't accept the fact that I'll never get to be with the girl I love. I don't really have any friends either, and the one I do have never wants to do anything beside play his xbox. All of the frinds I used to have from highschool have stopped hanging out with me. I can't make new friends because I have terrible social anxiety and I just end up embarassing myself.

I was sent to a mental hosptial a little over 2 months ago because I said I was going to kill myself on facebook. when I posted it no one even messaged me and asked if I was okay, no one paid any attention.

It seems like every time I fall back down, I just fall farther and harder. My life has been consistently full of problems for awhile now, but within the past week, things have just gotten considerably worse. 
Usually I can hide how I’m feeling, but this time is different. I’m wearing it constantly now. At work, customers are asking if I’m okay, at home my roommates keep checking on me. I don’t lie about how I’m feeling, but I don’t talk about it much either.!Everyone assumes I’m just slightly down this week. 
My home life between all my roommates is going to complete shit. My relationship with most of them has deteriorated beyond belief for the most part. Out of 6 of them, there’s only one I can say is still close to me. 
The love of my life, or atleast the one I thought was the love of my life has pushed me away. I’ve been strong and positive for her, she’s been my rock. She doesn’t even know how down I really am. She knows I’m depressed over her, but that doesn’t even scratch the surface of how bad everything is. 
And honestly I guess she won’t actually realize it until after everything is said and done. 
I’m always under so much pressure from my job, roommates, the chick, I just can’t do it anymore. There’s always something happening to where they have to depend on me for something very crucial. And Without her, I just can’t do this. Im not strong enough anymore. Im broken mentally and physically at this point. I feel like I’m incapable of feeling anything besides depression and self loathing. 
This isn’t her fault, fuck I’d probably push me away too. I fell in love with her and she doesn’t realize that she was actually helping me stand. It’s just a combination of everything and very ill timed events that shows no sign of getting better. 
I don’t wanna hurt anyone else emotionally or physically. I don’t even know if me being gone is gonna have an emotional toll on anyone around me to be honest. 
But..I don’t know when I’m gonna do it or how, but at some point this weekend I think I’m gonna finally have the courage to try to end this shit show, and hopefully be able to Rest In Peace for whatever comes next.

16217,"That's enough for me.In my life I went through really awful stuff. As a child growing up without my father who left me, living with my mother and her abusive husband, being beaten and humiliated by both of them, seeing my mother get spanked by him, being sexually abused by this same guy with my mother knowing it and doing nothing, having suicidal thoughts since I was 10y.o., fleeing home to live with my grandmother, meeting my father when I was 13y.o. and finding he was indeed an asshole that never gave a fuck about me, I turned out to be a very introvert, lonely, depressed and distrustful person.

Living with my grandmother was kind of a turning point for me. Even being depressed and psychologically fucked up I managed to achieve some cool stuff. I got into one of the best universities in Brasil to study computer science, got to work as a math and physics teacher in a school to make some money and started an indie game development company with some friends.

But about a year ago, I completely broke down. I couldn't focus on studying or working and couldn't get up from bed. At the same time I developed anxiety disorders, having panic attacks every morning, a growing OCD really strong and eating a lot, what got me really fat. My self-esteem, which was already low, got to zero. I entered into a really profound depression. I quit college. My life basically ended. This went on until I tried committing suicide without success thanks to my grandmother who fortunately got home from work earlier.

After this I started treating myself and got much better. Returned to college and reengaged contact with some friends. This went on for almost 3 months of living an almost normal life, even if I couldn't help but wonder every time about how empty I felt inside. I started feeling bad again and my grandmother got sick, and just the thought of being alone and losing the only person that really stands by me no matter what made me broken. I felt lonely, miserable and pretty much like before when I tried committing suicide.

What brings me now. Today is my birthday and I'm turning 21. Not a single person showed up, called me or congratulated me on fb, whatsapp or whatever. I really am alone. I really am miserable. I can no more withstand this much suffering and am seriously considering suicide. Think I could use some advice from you guys. I'm completely desperate. Please, no ""things will get better"" stuff 'cause they don't. Sorry for eventual English mistakes.

Thanks for reading.

956,"Typing something out before I sleepMan, the day was stressful. I really find myself scared of what I do feeling that. I can take a shower and feel flabbergasted that such actions could've existed.

I don't know what happens when people get older. They join causes. They become activists. They become conspiracy theorists. It happens to ALL OF THEM! They all think they're living works of fiction. Listen to them TALK! It's not that fiction imitates reality. It's that people imitate fiction. Maybe, though, you'll ask them ""what's realistic about movies"" and they'll say ""NOTHING!"" Okay, so why are they all afraid that ""reality is movies?""

How is Rugrats ""worse for kids"" than an R-rated movie or a porno? Hell if I know. The topless beach I was once taken to remains my worst enemy. Just a few hours there twenty years ago and what are people MOST hyperbolic about? Sex. Can't they talk normally? Each time I'm asked about ""topless beaches,"" I know what to expect. They sure have it wrong when I don't want to deal with their obsessions over ""lady nipples not being acceptable in this nation.""

When people get older, at least here, they start to complain about this nation. They cry about ""the better cultures."" I sure HAVE been told ""I've been sympathetic toward the enemy"" for saying that ""I don't care."" 

They have existential crises about whatever corporations get to be trendy. Apparently, they lose their childhood happiness.

I wasn't the kind of kid who was going to discover PBS on my own. Turned out that when kids got older and ""PBS was for babies,"" I couldn't recite jack shit from those shows. Being a toddler, I had hated people associating me with those shows.

People my age are fixated on nostalgia. I don't feel any nostalgia. When people got older and they had gained political views, I couldn't take part in that. Of course, I couldn't. When I had been a child, some things were far better than cartoons had been. It didn't mean they were good, but that didn't stop people from referring to me as a boy genius.

On top of all this, I have family that doesn't treat me well.

Each day, I put on the act and I'm sure visibly distressed. I don't want to deal with each day. Everything is nothing. Nothing is anything. That's not philosophy.

This gives me an inability to truly feel hatred or to understand everyone having ""morality"" fits. I'm always observing this humanity zoo.

9277,"I've set a dateI'm going to kill myself on December 30th if nothing gets better by then.

My story: 
I've dealt with anxiety, ocd, and panic since I was about 3 years old. I would line up my toys and if one was missing I would freak out. Fears escalated to diseases, rare illnesses, and cleanliness. There was a good half a year where I washed my hands like 20 times a day. 

Once middle school hit this turned into a more social anxiety. I was obsessed with fitting in. With having friends. With not being alone. 
Pretty normal stuff.

Then softmore year. I had a massive panic attack while smoking weed and felt derealization for the first time ever. I obsessed over it for months until one day I kind of just stopped. 

That obsession came back 2 years later. Worst 6 months of my life. Then I met the love of my life. Literally the most beautiful girl I've ever met. My mental health issues disappeared for a short time. 

Fast forward a few months. I start obsessing again. Constantly ruminting. Every day all day. My obsessions range from obsessing over emotions, like trying to hard to feel them, to obsessing over unanaswerable existential questions. 

When I say this is all day every day, I mean it.

Fast forward to today. Girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago. Said I didn't make her happy anymore. At this point I've seen 6 different therapists, I've tried every kind of therapy, ERP, CBT, etc. I've seen 4 different psychiatrists, tried 4 different meds. Nothing. At this point I'm so far into my own head I can't even really feel emotions. I'm just blank, and sometimes I panic and I'm always depressed. I can't do this anymore. Even if there's better times head it's just not worth it. This is who I am, I'll never be able to get out of my own head. I don't want to live anymore. There's no cure to anxiety ocd and depression. I can't deal with this for my whole life, even if it's managed. I'm not strong enough. 

I'm going to kill myself on December 30th this year if nothing gets better.

Sorry if this post left out some details, my head is so cloudy and I haven't had the ability to properly express myself in months. 

If there's another option I'll try it. But there isnt. This is my fate, I'm just gonna hang on for the next few months because I have just a sliver of hope left.

12750,"special friend applications!! 16F. 15-17M only. Hey everyone! I got inspired by this other girl’s post here about the google form app. I went ahead and did the same, but this time it’s for being my special friend. 

What is a special friend? 
- it’s someone who’s in between a friend and a bf (leading to be the boyfriend if we’re compatible and all goes well). 

Why am I doing this?
- I believe that there’s so much more to a boy’s looks, and I want to finally form a true connection with someone and not date purely for the looks (looks were my top priority when it came to dating guys, but I realized that it’s not all, obviously, that makes up a guy).

Things about me:
I’m 16 (turning 17 in 4 months woohoo) and I live in the Philippines. I enjoy talking about how things work, human evolution, and Netflix! I loved Lucifer, HIMYM, Friends, and Big Bang Theory! I also like learning about Greek Mythology and the likes. I like talking to people about fun stuff: memes, sarcastic banter, etc. I like dressing up too :) I value fashion sense and grooming. 

Here are my answers to my own form, so you can see and it’s fair.

I can be shy sometimes, but I’m mostly outgoing.

I consider myself to be a virtuous person.

My best quality is that I can get along with most people . People say I’m also charming when they meet me irl.

My worst quality is that I can be forgetful with the little things. So I need someone who is patient. 

If I could live anywhere, I’d live in NYC. I like the energy in that city.

I’m insecure about my laziness sometimes.

I’m looking for a guy who is respectful, a great conversationalist, will make me laugh, witty, happy, positive, kind, and caring. (Plus points if you’re Chinese/Korean)

I’m expecting to be someone who would be one of your support systems, someone who you could talk to and debate with, and someone who you could just have those shallow conversations with.

I’m still torn. I’d most likely be a lawyer.

I value honesty the most.

The kindest thing I’ve done (we actually do it every year) was go on an annual Christmas food drive to give food to the ones who were spending their Christmases on the streets. 

The worst thing I’ve done was sneaking out the house late at night to go watch a Marvel movie.

Mentioned my hobbies already.

I do have a good relationship with my parents.

I am in the upper class.

It wasn’t terrible, besides that there was a ton of bugs, and towards the end me and my mom started overhearing the table next to us (solid 5-6 feet away) because they were talking pretty loud. There’s this little kid, maybe 5-6, that was complaining that his baseball team was bad, he was in a jersey so he must have just played a game with his little league, and he was upset because his team wasn’t contributing. The dad (dad I think?) had to explain to him that it was okay, etc etc etc. I was cracking jokes at our table about how “I was so used to this conversation because I’m the best at everything” and “I’ve heard it all before”. Anyways I wish I hadn’t. At the end right before we left, my mom hears the dad (I think the dad. She told me what she heard but I don’t remember who she said said it) say “I hope the kid who tested positive wasn’t the really good player”. Come the fuck again? First off, stop being a whiny ass bitch that your team is bad when one of your teammates caught the fucking virus. Be happy you’re not on a ventilator. Second, to the adults at the table, why the fuck, **why the fuck**, are you eating out in public, around people, when you fucking know someone who tested positive. Why the fuck are you not quarantining, why are you out where you’re touching plates and within feet of waiters and waitresses when you know damn well you might be carriers. I don’t know if this mystery kid was at a game when he was positive. He may have caught it early. The kid may not have it. They may not have it. They probably didn’t give it to us, we were distanced. But take fucking precaution. Just because you may not care about getting it, you clearly don’t if you’re more upset your bitch ass baseball team sucking than having a life threatening virus, doesn’t mean others don’t. Stay home if you were potentially in contact or proximity. I wish death upon no one but these are the kind of people that I wouldn’t be upset if they caught the virus.

1068,"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.
Also, in case someone was wondering why I don't go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it's because my ex is literally the only friend I have. I had a clique that we both hung out with but I(stupidly) pushed them away.",suicide,"yesterday i was talked out of suicide by my ex boyfriend i don t really know what to say here, i just feel like i need to get all this off of my chest for the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when i was in a really great place in life recently the past few months things have gotten worse for me multiple factors are piling up and it s starting to feel like it s entirely too much to handle this past weekend i stayed at my ex s house and tonight when i got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and i just wanted to end it i was actually going to do it for some reason though, i spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed he has school today , he wants me to get help but i can t afford to get any he told me that he might turn me in which i think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what i ve been thinking of i told him i d never forgive him, and i can t handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down i would give anything to have some help i ve told him for over a year now that i need help and i think he s just now starting to believe me he told me he will get me help no matter what, but i m so afraid of some authority figure finding out what i ve been thinking of doing i can t even talk to anyone face to face about it i can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face i m not sure if i have social anxiety the talking to people/being around people part , depression, both, or neither but i m sure that i m sick of my life being this way i m sick of existing and not living i found this subreddit through mmfb which i found through iama , and i just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown i don t know if you ve read this far, but if you have thank you if you care for me to, i can try to keep this updated also, in case someone was wondering why i don t go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it s because my ex is literally the only friend i have i had a clique that we both hung out with but i stupidly pushed them away ",452
2395,"I don't even know why am I writing thisI feel so stuck, so bound in this situation.
In 3 hours I'm going at work again, where I'm going to suffer the same injustices everyone suffers everywhere at every job, and even worst, but really I can't take anymore those people being slower than me, and yet blaming me for things i shouldn't be blamed of. 
I had so many fights, but yet I can't revolt against them more than I already did cause I need this damn job.

So I'm super stressed at work but when I go back home there's my damn family situation, my mom says in 5 days the judge is coming to our home to see what can be taken away and sold so the state can get his tax money back, the ones my dad wasn't able to pay. ""Fortunately"" (I don't really care) they said if we give them 4000 euro right now they'll make us a payment plan for the restant 40000 euros... So I'll have to ""lend"" my money to my dad again (I know I'll never see them back) this month and the same story comes along every damn month.
My dad has debts everywhere, I don't even know how much, and my mom says I'll have to hold on for other like 3-4 years in this cursed situation. 
But this is just an random estimate. I'm forced in this situation, I'm 23 years old and don't know when I'll be free, maybe when I'll be 30?
Our home is under risk every month.

Then, even worst, my mom is sick, she can't work, my dad left and betrayed her, I DON'T love her but I feel forced to take care of here until she dies or takes away her own life.
I don't have any mental illness, I'd like to become a music producer, to make money, I think love is so stupid and I don't care for anyone other than my self, and I believe everyone is egoistic too in the deep inside, but yet I'm scared of death, feel so coward. Hanging hurts, ""mortal"" electrical towers are not mortal at all, the only thing I could do right now would be to take the knife I usually take to my job, which has a new sharp blade and cut my throat but I'm so scared of how it would hurt, and I'm so stupidly worried about the shock I'll cause to my mom...

6344,"I'm cant handle thisIve been depressed since I can remember, at first it was just laziness and no caring about my well being.  Weed definitely helped, it forced my mind into a fake state of happiness and I did my best to never be sober. As the stress from debt piling up and exhaustion from getting next to no sleep every night for months on end added to everything else I couldn't handle it. My roommates girlfriend gave us bedbugs, would steal from me constantly, and would take my car whenever she wanted, causing a huge commotion if she didn't get her way. My job was illegally screwing me out of money I needed to pay my bills but I could afford to do anything, my teeth started to fall apart and decay to the point of no return, my friends spent less and less time with me each day, I was done. After going and getting ready for my choice of leaving this world, I texted my goodbyes to the ones I cared about the most, posted my note on Facebook and set out on my path to find a quiet place to give up. I'm still not sure if this was fortunate or not, but I had a wellness check called on me, and I was picked up by the police and placed in a hospital. I thought I got better since then, most of the problems still remained, but I was chipping away at my debt and found someone I love more than anything, it was going good until I lost my job. After working there for three years, management changed for the third time and the new head manager wanted her son to have my position so they made my life a living hell, there wasn't a day I wouldn't get chewed out for at least half an hour. I'm so lost as to what to do anymore, I wake up in the morning and am angry that I woke up, completing suicide sounds better as each day passes. I can't get myself out of this debt, there aren't many jobs in my area and even with buying the bare minimum for essentials I still can't make a living at any other jobs, I want to give up. I guess you could say this is sort of my note, I'm going to give it myself 2 days to try figuring out this problem I haven't been able to fix before I end it for good.

6666,"Feel pretty rubbish about myself rn I'm pan/ace female in a relationship with a straight/ace male, and my sister is bi in a relationship with a bi male.



My sister is very loud and proud about her sexuality and LGBT issues, whereas her boyfriend and myself are more closeted. Nothing wrong with either of those, but sometimes she likes to throw it in your face a bit, and constantly talks about how sexy/fit/attractive girls are in front of her boyfriend, which apparently he feels bad about (and I'm sure if he was talking about dudes she'd be upset). 



She claims to understand LGBT and mental health issues with her activism, but if you mention a problem, she'll often make fun of you / make a joke which isn't funny.



Basically my town have pride flags up at the moment, and I was upset because I hadn't seen a pan or ace flag yet. I saw a NB flag today (possibly questioning if I'm NB atm but only a few people know) and it made me happy. 



We walked past and I said 'guess the flag' and she was like 'non-binary' and I was like 'yeah' all excitedly. As a joke, I pointed out the rainbow flag and asked her to guess (because everyone knows that flag) and she said 'stop trying to pretend like you're gayer than me', which really hurt. I'm not as open about my sexuality, and I've never been with another gender apart from male so it made me really upset.



We then walked past a pan flag and I freaked. I was so happy because I hadn't seen one yet! And I was saying how cool it was and she was like 'I'd call myself pan but I can't be arsed'... Like, what?? Then went to say how she can label herself what she likes. Of course she can, but it's weird that she'd say that as if being pansexual is a bad thing.



And finally, I said 'now we have to find an asexual flag', and she said 'yeah but remember asexuals don't exist'. I was like WTF, and she said it was a joke. Not very funny, is it?! See what I mean about showing how she cares for the community but then makes a remark like that? It happens constantly. Especially with my mental health triggers. 



Nothing she said today was funny. None of it. I can't believe she had the audacity to say that and invalidate both me and my boyfriend.

10935,"Is it pathetic to like Have a dream about being hugged by a role model? Last night I was afraid my stepdad was gonna attack me and my mom like he does when he’s on steroids and I panicked. I’ve been told by so many people on reddit or in real life if things get bad go to an adult, or if I need advice go to an adult an not other kids. So, I went to my ex’s dad. He’s the best adult I’ve EVER seen. When he was mad he didn’t hit or scream or throw things at people he would calmly raise his voice (not yell or scream, just gain volume) and say he was disappointed and did you not know the consequences of your actions (he did this to my bf at the time in front of us). Even when shit hit the fan, he never screamed or attacked me like I thought people would and it made me wanna cry I disappointed this man. I overshared a lot because of the adrenaline, and he gave caring but short answers. I think I may have told a little too much about the abuse continuing (they kinda knew but I wasn’t told the Extent) in my home. I eventually calmed down and felt weird about texting him. I don’t regret going to him, he’s the only adult I know is a good person fully. But, I’m scared he’s shared this with his family (which is understandable this was a concerning situation) and that they may have gained more disdain for me and my mother. His dad and grandma are like comfort figures to me, I trust them a lot more then most people and his dad is my role model. But, my ex best friend is my ex bfs sister, and she wants me dead I just know it. I don’t know how my ex feels, by the day I try to erase his memory so I can live without crying under knowing I disappointed a whole group of people I loved dearly. When I finally did go to bed, I slept with a weighted blanket that was supposed to take away nightmares which if you check my profile I have quite often. I didn’t dream of my ex (surprising!) or nightmarish figures, I dream of getting ice cream with their dad and getting a hug before it floated to something different without him.

So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out.  I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.

By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of  countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 

In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)

5803,"My world has come crashing down and I can't see any other escapeI also posted this in r/depression and so I'm sorry for double posting but I feel like this thread was actually more suitable. Here's my story...


I've just been dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years for another girl with who he's been friends with since before we met. He slept with her before we met and apparently has been talking to her without me knowing all throughout our relationship. He hasn't 'physically cheated' per se (that I know of) but I feel he's been 'emotionally cheating' on me for a while. It hurts so f%$king much that it's actually like physical pain at the moment and I can't stop crying. He's also refusing to talk to me. We all live in the same place and I'm just heartbroken and horrified by the idea that I have to see them together in the future and bump into them.
I've also found out that my dad also had an affair with someone when I was 18 years old (I'm now 26) and when I had anorexia (I was close to dying from my anorexia) and cheated on my mum . They've been married for 35 years and my dad has always been my rock who I've always looked up to. Their relationship was one I idolised and always wanted. I can't get my head around the idea he cheated on my mum. My sister died when she was 8 and I was 4 and they managed to get through that. My mum deserves so much better and I'm so angry that he could ever do that to her at such a vulnerable time in their lives.
This year I've also lost my best friends after an incident happened at a Hen Party which made me re-evaluate if they were actually 'friends'. They were acting bitchy and awful and so I ended up telling the bride that I don't think I could be her bridesmaid anymore and she ended the friendship and all the other friends sided with her.
I've lost my friends, my partner, and my Dad in such a short space of time. I feel like I have nothing but my job but even though I love my job it's not enough to keep me going. I feel like no one wants me in their lives. I can't stop crying and I just want to die. I don't see what the point to anything is anymore. My mum is my only friend I have.",suicide,"my world has come crashing down and i can t see any other escapei also posted this in r/depression and so i m sorry for double posting but i feel like this thread was actually more suitable here s my story   i ve just been dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years for another girl with who he s been friends with since before we met he slept with her before we met and apparently has been talking to her without me knowing all throughout our relationship he hasn t physically cheated per se that i know of but i feel he s been emotionally cheating on me for a while it hurts so f king much that it s actually like physical pain at the moment and i can t stop crying he s also refusing to talk to me we all live in the same place and i m just heartbroken and horrified by the idea that i have to see them together in the future and bump into them i ve also found out that my dad also had an affair with someone when i was 18 years old i m now 26 and when i had anorexia i was close to dying from my anorexia and cheated on my mum  they ve been married for 35 years and my dad has always been my rock who i ve always looked up to their relationship was one i idolised and always wanted i can t get my head around the idea he cheated on my mum my sister died when she was 8 and i was 4 and they managed to get through that my mum deserves so much better and i m so angry that he could ever do that to her at such a vulnerable time in their lives this year i ve also lost my best friends after an incident happened at a hen party which made me re evaluate if they were actually friends  they were acting bitchy and awful and so i ended up telling the bride that i don t think i could be her bridesmaid anymore and she ended the friendship and all the other friends sided with her i ve lost my friends, my partner, and my dad in such a short space of time i feel like i have nothing but my job but even though i love my job it s not enough to keep me going i feel like no one wants me in their lives i can t stop crying and i just want to die i don t see what the point to anything is anymore my mum is my only friend i have ",450
9420,"Second attempt I think about killing myself a majority of my days, it is the main thing that occupies my thoughts and it has been for at least two months now. I have decided that I will try again, this weekend, using charcoal grills in the car to poison myself with Carbon Monoxide. I think about the details. I think about how and where I can light the grills and not get caught. Where I can park and not be found. I think about how to let someone know to be careful when they open the door. I think about how this will effect the people close to me and loosely connected. I think about how little I have prepared and how I have not left money for a funeral. I google cost of a funeral and realize its 10k which is so much money. I think of the burden I will be leaving on so many, but I realize that I won’t be around to have to deal with the reprocutions of it. This reaffirms that I am a selfish, no-good person who does not really love people, just uses them. I worry about something regarding work and then think, well I won’t have to worry about that since I will be gone. I write action items for work, and think, this is silly because I will be gone by Monday. I eat cake. I don’t exercise. I don’t talk at the meeting. I try to talk at the dinner table and feel judged and awkward. In the back of my mind, I think, maybe I can get through this, but I realize I’ve already fucked myself over so far. 

I feel to far down the rabbit hole to get out. I see happy people and I hate them. 

I am the most boring, miserable person I know and I want to die. I’m going to do it Saturday. I’m surprised I made it this far. It is not the job. It is not my friends or family who love me. It is me. It is that I feel sick all over with hate for myself. It is that I am selfish, boring, fake and unskilled and have fooled people for some time. It’s that I feel dead inside, I feel dirty, ugly and sick. I see everything in the negative, I have no passion, no goals, nothing in my life that brings me joy. I cannot imagine a world where I will. True, I have felt intense joy before, but it is so fleeting, and I don’t trust it anymore. Joy because of a new romance, a party, a drug, a new job or success. False. Fake.

14284,"I'm starting to think that horses just aren't part of my destiny; that there is some global/universal law purposely keeping them away from me.Please hear me out.

I've had a secret love and passion for horses for most of my life. Yet in all those years do you wanna guess how many times I've actually gotten to be around them? Three or four TOPS, though I'm not sure exactly. But suffice it to say, it is an extremely rare thing for me to touch them, play with them, ride them, etc. Basically, the variables surrounding my life, my family, my community, and my geographic area have made horses essentially unavailable to me, but the worst part is that there HAVE been times where the opportunity has been SO close, only to be snatched away from me. I swear to God that's always how this goes!!! After years of longing I'll FINALLY have some kind of riding opportunity come up, and then things go wrong. In the latest case, it was the stupid ass pandemic.

And this is what leads me to believe that despite my intense longing and love for these animals, horses just weren't meant to be a part of my life. Whatever god is up there, whatever sort of cosmic force that controls the universe had decided it's not in the cards for me. That has to be it, because why else would a horse-loving girl like myself constantly find herself disappointed? ALWAYS have something getting in the way of her dreams? I see pictures of other people kissing their horses on the nose and the horse rubbing them back, and it makes me cry, because I know I will never have that chance. A horse will never love me, and even if it does, it won't happen anytime in the foreseeable future. And folks, I'm just so tired of waiting. I'm tired of exhausting my search engine trying to look for horse interaction opportunities only to come up empty-handed.

I love animals so much. I'm always going out of my way to cuddle and feed cats that come around the house, because they're adorable and I want to be their friend. I just want an animal, especially a horse, to love me back. But will that ever happen? I'm so lonely. I have no friends. I'm sorry, but I've waited for 20+ years, and I can't do it anymore. I feel like this may be God's way of saying I don't deserve to find happiness; that I should forever be alone in this world.",suicide,"i m starting to think that horses just aren t part of my destiny that there is some global/universal law purposely keeping them away from me please hear me out  i ve had a secret love and passion for horses for most of my life yet in all those years do you wanna guess how many times i ve actually gotten to be around them? three or four tops, though i m not sure exactly but suffice it to say, it is an extremely rare thing for me to touch them, play with them, ride them, etc basically, the variables surrounding my life, my family, my community, and my geographic area have made horses essentially unavailable to me, but the worst part is that there have been times where the opportunity has been so close, only to be snatched away from me i swear to god that s always how this goes  after years of longing i ll finally have some kind of riding opportunity come up, and then things go wrong in the latest case, it was the stupid ass pandemic  and this is what leads me to believe that despite my intense longing and love for these animals, horses just weren t meant to be a part of my life whatever god is up there, whatever sort of cosmic force that controls the universe had decided it s not in the cards for me that has to be it, because why else would a horse loving girl like myself constantly find herself disappointed? always have something getting in the way of her dreams? i see pictures of other people kissing their horses on the nose and the horse rubbing them back, and it makes me cry, because i know i will never have that chance a horse will never love me, and even if it does, it won t happen anytime in the foreseeable future and folks, i m just so tired of waiting i m tired of exhausting my search engine trying to look for horse interaction opportunities only to come up empty handed  i love animals so much i m always going out of my way to cuddle and feed cats that come around the house, because they re adorable and i want to be their friend i just want an animal, especially a horse, to love me back but will that ever happen? i m so lonely i have no friends i m sorry, but i ve waited for 20 years, and i can t do it anymore i feel like this may be god s way of saying i don t deserve to find happiness that i should forever be alone in this world ",450
1326,"Just sick of it.  What's the fucking point.You're born, you grow up, you work a shitty job for a few years, you get laid off, you swallow your pride and eat shit to find more work, you meet someone you think is nice, you spend time with them and maybe have a kid or two, that person changes, you don't, suddenly they don't want to be with you anymore and your kids are caught in the middle...   

Then after all that emotional turmoil and endless working you eventually get old, get a bunch of diseases that you Wikipedia and understand exactly the way they're killing you, but it doesn't change anything and understanding it doesn't make it any easier.   Then you die, and maybe you're lucky and a couple people are there by your side when you cease to exist.   Maybe, but probably not - they have jobs and relationships to manage too and their bosses aren't very understanding when it comes to this stuff.  Being a decent human being cuts into their bottom line.

I'm sick of it.   I'm sick of having only this pointless life to look forward to.   I'm sick of being alone.   People only give a fuck when they have something to gain - even here on this subreddit, you bastards are doing this because you get a fucking masturbatory ego boost from thinking you ""helped"" someone.   You wanna help someone?   Go outside and talk to someone who looks lonely.  Stop fucking around on here.

So what if it gets depressing, actually risk having a down night instead of coming here where you can alt+f4 the minute you start getting uncomfortable.  Actually give something.   Shit.

We're all so fucking busy with our Facebook and our iPhones and our goddamn blogs that we've stopped talking to eachother face to face.

That's what we have to look forward to, a future filled with people absorbed in their own bullshit.   

I don't want to live in that world.

Fuck everyone who's ever seen someone who needed help and didn't reach out.

Fuck everyone who ever stepped on someone else for personal gain.

Fuck everyone who's ever hated someone just because they were different.

Fuck my parents for bringing me into this shithole.

And fuck me for waiting this long thinking I just had to give it a chance.

From here on is my previous post, after this comes the edit.

""We have met in a game only about a week ago and I already know a lot about you. You are depressed and suicidal, the things you went through must be unbearable. We have been talking on snapchat and you were telling me things that really made me sad. I sometimes bug you and call you to make sure you are alright and spam you but that's only because I care. Yesterday at night I wrote to you for the last time as I didn't get any response anymore after calling and messaging several times. Today I really got anxious and took action. I live in another country but I still took measures and called the institutions you said you were going to. I even called your school and the police. Sadly they wouldn't tell me if you were alright or not because of security reasons. I kept calling your school and they told me if I called one more time I would get reported. I called the police and they told me they'd send a unit to your school to make sure you were ok. About an hour/1,5  ago I saw your snapchat location showed you were online at that moment. I still try to reach for you. And I am very sorry if I vexed you and caused you trouble. The police told me they would contact your parents, and I know your father is an asshole and tells you to kill yourself, so I hope he didn't flip out or anything. I wanted to come visit you in London but you refused and didn't feeI comfortable with it which is understandable, I asked for your phone number you didn't give it for the same reason. But thank god I know your first name and I knew which school you are going to, I dug and found your surname as well, and gave it to the police. I  just hope everything is alright and may god be with you. Don't leave me please, I am dying from inside...""

I’m exhausted with life and I wish I could just be at rest but I can’t leave my mom alone nor make her go through having to grieve her daughter. Sometimes i’m like fuck it just do it and plan it but I don’t have the guts right when i’m about toI’ve been feeling suicidal for the past few months. My brother has scared our mother who is battling cancer with suicidal thoughts and attempts over the past year. Now I feel me, who is the only person who lives and cares for her can’t also be suicidal. So I would never try to speak to my mother who is my best friend about my thoughts even though I feel like it would help me and she would be able to somehow cure me because she’s a fucking perfect amazing problem solver who fixes everything.

Not to mention making her bury her own child and have to go through with that. I’m also engaged but I can’t talk to my fiancé either because I’m terrified he’s going to think he’s not good enough or it’s his fault or something and he’ll probably feel like shit or like i’m crazy. It’s off the table to talk to him or my mom about this. 

I just want to be selfish and end it and finally not have to deal with the burden of existing every single day literally every second because it’s so tiring and i’m so sick of it.

7398,"My parents don't let me spend my own money? Alright, maybe not the correct place to ask, but I figured y'all must have experience on this.

I am currently 15, and I have saved money for myself my whole life. Money I got from birthdays, Christmas, and other stuff. I have a pretty hefty amount saved there, almost 4 digit numbers.

I have a game that I really like, and I want to buy a skin to support the developers, on top of being my fav skin. The Skin costs 25€ (flame me all u want, but my money my choice remember that)

They say I need to save money for my drivers license, but thanks to my hardworking grandfather (who unfortunately isn't here with us anymore) who worked all his life to make mine and my mum's life easier, there is a separate bank account with money for my loans, car, and drivers license, so I didn't need to save for these things.

She literally hid the money somewhere I can't find. And if I ask to use her own money, she's going to ask my dad, who NO WAY in fucking hell is going to let me. Even if it was 99 cents.

I also want to spend money on a new mouse (and on generally things I want and that make me happy), since mine is literally broke and I really need one for school work, but I talk to her and she's like ""too expensive"" (45€ mouse btw, not expensive at all considering what I'm getting). And if I talk back to her with valid arguments, ""You're ungrateful"", ""My house my rules"", ""Don't talk back"".

I see my friends having fun in some games that I can't even buy because I can't use my money and my parents don't let me use theirs.

I know theres the point of teaching me money management, but firstly:

I have been taught very well to spend it only on things that I need, and rarely on things that we want (not never, but not everyday either).

And secondly,

For me to test my money management, I need to have money to manage in the first place!

How do I talk to her without getting the ""You're ungrateful"", ""My house my rules"", ""Don't talk back"", as well as getting grounded and not being able to do anything electronic wise for 1 motnh (its literally all I have to entertain myself), as well as being able to buy things I want/need?

Thanks boys and girls!",non-suicide,"my parents don t let me spend my own money? alright, maybe not the correct place to ask, but i figured y all must have experience on this  i am currently 15, and i have saved money for myself my whole life money i got from birthdays, christmas, and other stuff i have a pretty hefty amount saved there, almost 4 digit numbers  i have a game that i really like, and i want to buy a skin to support the developers, on top of being my fav skin the skin costs 25 flame me all u want, but my money my choice remember that  they say i need to save money for my drivers license, but thanks to my hardworking grandfather who unfortunately isn t here with us anymore who worked all his life to make mine and my mum s life easier, there is a separate bank account with money for my loans, car, and drivers license, so i didn t need to save for these things  she literally hid the money somewhere i can t find and if i ask to use her own money, she s going to ask my dad, who no way in fucking hell is going to let me even if it was 99 cents  i also want to spend money on a new mouse and on generally things i want and that make me happy , since mine is literally broke and i really need one for school work, but i talk to her and she s like too expensive  45 mouse btw, not expensive at all considering what i m getting  and if i talk back to her with valid arguments, you re ungrateful , my house my rules , don t talk back  i see my friends having fun in some games that i can t even buy because i can t use my money and my parents don t let me use theirs  i know theres the point of teaching me money management, but firstly  i have been taught very well to spend it only on things that i need, and rarely on things that we want not never, but not everyday either  and secondly, for me to test my money management, i need to have money to manage in the first place  how do i talk to her without getting the you re ungrateful , my house my rules , don t talk back , as well as getting grounded and not being able to do anything electronic wise for 1 motnh its literally all i have to entertain myself , as well as being able to buy things i want/need? thanks boys and girls ",447
9328,"I don’t know how much longer I can hold together.I’ve been feeling depressed for many years now, I’ve never been to a therapist or anything because I am extremely afraid of confrontation, asking for help, etc. Over the last few weeks, I didn’t feel absolutely horrible but I’m almost at my breaking point now.

I came out to my mom as FtM around 9 months ago and she wasn’t accepting, she told me I just wanted attention. Fast forward to September, she accepts me as her son and has been calling me by my preferred name. Yesterday, however, she looks through my recently deleted photos and finds pictures of my arm, and without even clicking on the picture she assumed they were dicks. She yelled at me about how I was a fake trans and I just wanted attention and I didn’t even have a fucking clue what was going on. She assumed that I was faking it and lying. She did not listen to a single thing I tried to say.

The only thing over the past few months that ever made me feel ok was that support she gave me. It’s gone. I’ll never get it back. No one in my family supports me.

 Before this all happened I was feeling really shitty and thought about killing myself a few times, but now I can’t stop thinking about it. I know exactly how I would do it, too:


I have a whole bottle of sleeping pills that I sometimes try to get high off of when I’m in a bad mood. Me being 100 lbs, if I took all of them I’d surely die. Since my mom goes to work at around 4-5am, I would take them as soon as she leaves (when she goes to my floor in the house I instantly wake up). I would skip school that day, and she’s been getting at home around 5 so by then, I’d be dead or passed out. If I’m lucky enough to pass out in my room with my door closed, I’ll be dead by the time she finds me.

I seriously don’t want to live anymore. I have no motivation to live anymore, and this isn’t my only problem right now. My mind cannot seem to grasp the concept of people caring about me. It’s physically impossible for me to imagine people mourning over my death. 

I can’t talk to anyone in real life about these problems, either. It’s not as easy as “Hey mom can I get a therapist” or whatever. She will probably tell me that I just want attention. I think I might actually kill myself next week.",suicide,"i dont know how much longer i can hold together ive been feeling depressed for many years now, ive never been to a therapist or anything because i am extremely afraid of confrontation, asking for help, etc over the last few weeks, i didnt feel absolutely horrible but im almost at my breaking point now  i came out to my mom as ftm around 9 months ago and she wasnt accepting, she told me i just wanted attention fast forward to september, she accepts me as her son and has been calling me by my preferred name yesterday, however, she looks through my recently deleted photos and finds pictures of my arm, and without even clicking on the picture she assumed they were dicks she yelled at me about how i was a fake trans and i just wanted attention and i didnt even have a fucking clue what was going on she assumed that i was faking it and lying she did not listen to a single thing i tried to say  the only thing over the past few months that ever made me feel ok was that support she gave me its gone ill never get it back no one in my family supports me  before this all happened i was feeling really shitty and thought about killing myself a few times, but now i cant stop thinking about it i know exactly how i would do it, too  i have a whole bottle of sleeping pills that i sometimes try to get high off of when im in a bad mood me being 100 lbs, if i took all of them id surely die since my mom goes to work at around 4 5am, i would take them as soon as she leaves when she goes to my floor in the house i instantly wake up  i would skip school that day, and shes been getting at home around 5 so by then, id be dead or passed out if im lucky enough to pass out in my room with my door closed, ill be dead by the time she finds me  i seriously dont want to live anymore i have no motivation to live anymore, and this isnt my only problem right now my mind cannot seem to grasp the concept of people caring about me its physically impossible for me to imagine people mourning over my death  i cant talk to anyone in real life about these problems, either its not as easy as hey mom can i get a therapist or whatever she will probably tell me that i just want attention i think i might actually kill myself next week ",447
9807,"Lost all future prospects and have been on the edge for the past few days.TLDR; Title

Hello all,

I've come here mainly because I have nowhere else to go.

Some background: I'm a 17 year old junior attending a Christian private school.  I've been struggling with depression for a while, but I managed to work through a lot of that and carry on with my life.

Now if this doesn't sound super terrible, that's because it's not, and honestly I have no idea why I'm posting here when there are people with real problems, but I'm far enough there's no reason to stop now.  A few days ago I was caught sexting with a friend of mine by her extremely religious parents, who then proceeded to tell my parents who are also fairly religious, and it just went downhill from there.  It all looks really bad for me.  Even though we both participated, I am seen as the main aggressor since I am the male, and can be kicked out of the school that I have been attending almost my entire life.  Not only that, but as she's a minor (a few months younger than me, which makes no sense but whatever), I can be convicted as a sexual predator, further ruining any prospects for college or anything afterwards as well.

I have no one to turn to.  My parents hate me for ruining my own and in turn their name, and I only have one close friend who I normally bring this type of stuff to, but she's the one I'm currently banned from contacting... I have no one I can trust or talk through this with, and there haven't been too many moments in the past few days that I haven't been considering ending it out of horror at my actions and utter humiliation, and if the rest of my grade (around 80 kids) found out about this, my only reason for hesitation would purely be the fact that I'm a coward with no backbone (repetitive ik, but whatever).  I know that one of the reasons I'm posting this is because I want to be convinced otherwise, but I'm so numb to just about everything at the moment that I would have absolutely no qualms with ending it.

I have no idea what to do.  There is no reason for me to keep going seeing as my entire life is now forfeit, and I'd rather get out without any more suffering on my part or anyone else's.  Also, please ignore how pathetic this is.",suicide,"lost all future prospects and have been on the edge for the past few days tldr title hello all, i ve come here mainly because i have nowhere else to go  some background i m a 17 year old junior attending a christian private school  i ve been struggling with depression for a while, but i managed to work through a lot of that and carry on with my life  now if this doesn t sound super terrible, that s because it s not, and honestly i have no idea why i m posting here when there are people with real problems, but i m far enough there s no reason to stop now  a few days ago i was caught sexting with a friend of mine by her extremely religious parents, who then proceeded to tell my parents who are also fairly religious, and it just went downhill from there  it all looks really bad for me  even though we both participated, i am seen as the main aggressor since i am the male, and can be kicked out of the school that i have been attending almost my entire life  not only that, but as she s a minor a few months younger than me, which makes no sense but whatever , i can be convicted as a sexual predator, further ruining any prospects for college or anything afterwards as well  i have no one to turn to  my parents hate me for ruining my own and in turn their name, and i only have one close friend who i normally bring this type of stuff to, but she s the one i m currently banned from contacting  i have no one i can trust or talk through this with, and there haven t been too many moments in the past few days that i haven t been considering ending it out of horror at my actions and utter humiliation, and if the rest of my grade around 80 kids found out about this, my only reason for hesitation would purely be the fact that i m a coward with no backbone repetitive ik, but whatever  i know that one of the reasons i m posting this is because i want to be convinced otherwise, but i m so numb to just about everything at the moment that i would have absolutely no qualms with ending it  i have no idea what to do  there is no reason for me to keep going seeing as my entire life is now forfeit, and i d rather get out without any more suffering on my part or anyone else s  also, please ignore how pathetic this is ",447

I don't understand it. I know that I will just be gone. I'll just blend with Earth. I'm not scared of Hell. I'm not scared of the unknown. I'm not scared of possible pain that will come with whatever method I use to kill myself. 

The things that do scare me won't matter when I'm dead. I won't even know they are happening, or not happening. It won't matter that no one will notice I'm gone. It won't matter that no one cared enough to try to stop me. It won't matter that no one recognizes that I am a unique and incredibly special person. It won't matter that I won't be remembered....

Why is it that people on a fucking suicide sub have zero empathy for another human being? I'm fucking angry at all of you. I HATE YOU.

I AM JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOU.

I think my desire for success is what is stopping me. That is what I fear. That my life will have meant nothing. I""m supposed to be the person that helps the world slide into Anarchy. But how can I change the world when everyone pretends I don't exist.

Maybe I have to give up the dream that I matter.

Maybe by ignoring me you are helping me find my destiny. Maybe I really have no place on Earth. Maybe I was meant to be ignored, so I can stop fearing going through with death. Maybe going to a support board full of selfish assholes is what will make me finally shoot myself.

2050,"Never thought I'd be having suicidal thoughts.I don't really care that this is my main account.

I'm currently camping with my four best friends in the world. We planned this trip for ages and now it's actually happening, but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone. Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die. One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn't revolve around me, which is of course right. I shouldn't be controlling them, it's just the anxiety talking.

I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three, when we decided to go to bed. However, despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset. I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely, to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it. You can't just forget anxiety issues, they're always there.

I cried myself to sleep, then woke early this morning shaking. Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them, so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar. I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake, so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me. She said she'd been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick. I was finally happy - he actually cared.

When we got back to the tent, he was asleep. I don't know about you but when I'm worried sick about someone I don't fall asleep until they're found. I left again. I'm now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out. I'm always there for them, but I never feel like they care for me at all. I'm entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life - maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they'd finally care about me? I'm tempted to make myself throw up right now so they might actually take me seriously. I'm a disgrace, and everyone's fed up with me.

6215,"I’m confused, I can’t stop spiralling.I was raped. But I wasn’t. 
I can’t understand him. I don’t know what he was thinking. I feel like I can’t even remember what happened clearly anymore.

After the first time, I kept going back. I asked for more. I asked him to hurt me, to kill me.

He almost did. I wish I knew what he was thinking. 

He always told me how delusional I was. And I know. I deluded myself as a coping mechanism.

I always try to make sense of it all but I can’t. Did I make him worse? Was he like this to begin with? 

What if I hurt him as much as he hurt me.

What if I’m just placing the blame on him so I can feel better.

I can’t even express how I feel because it’s such a mess inside my head.

I recently turned 18 and started university this year. It’s been 5 months since I attempted suicide.

I’m haven’t been in contact with him for months too. 

I think about him everyday. The idea of him instantly makes me dizzy, sick and horrified.

But he is not a monster. He’s kind and caring in many ways.

He strangles me when I keep fighting back. He bites me so hard that I scream. He inflicts pain upon me until I pass out. He has sex with me when I beg him to stop. He tells me everything is going to be okay when I cry. He let’s the room be dark since I don’t want to be seen naked. He lets us stay under the sheets when he rapes me because I want it. He asks if I’m okay during it. He stokes my head. He asks before he punches me. He apologises after. He wants to kill himself after because he is so sorry. 

I wish I could forget it all. I loved him, I really believe I did. And maybe I still do. I miss a lot of things.

Everything is a mess. I’ve been to multiple mental health professionals and it hasn’t helped.

One man told me I wasn’t at all depressed and smirked when I brought up masochism. He asked me if my vagina hurt when I was raped.

Others disregard it completely. They’re right. I wasn’t raped. I caused it. I was foolish.

I’m tired. I was depressed before I met him. And after all these years it’s still here.

But I’m happy. I get my studies done, I socialise often, I even got a casual job, people always ask how I’m always so full of energy and happy.

9506,"Got dumped and having a hard time handling itIt's been almost a month since the break up, Jan 2. And it's been a struggle and the thought has crossed my mind through out the past month more times than I can count. I just feel so worthless. 
           
 Here's the girl that I loved with all my being and I made sure she knew it everyday and then it's gone. She tells me she doesn't love me anymore. And a year of my life and all that work effort and closeness to that person is now gone. And I have no one to blame but myself for just being a shitty bf too often.
           
  And recently I've been seeing her around with a new guy not even 3ish weeks later. This was devastating. He not only gets her but he also managed to pick her up in a fraction of the time I took. All throughout our relationship I can recall how much she said ""lol I don't do relationships"" before and even occasionally during us dating. She even stated in her whole break up speach that she still ""didn't do relationships""
         
   And now I feel as if I don't have anyone to turn to. I see this girl almost everyday cause we're still in school together and we have extracurriculars together and it pains me to see her, and I end up getting super depressed and just wishing I was dead.
          
The only thing that has stopped me from being so is I to the best of my ability don't want to do that to my parents. But with how this feeling just keeps getting worse I don't think that'll stop me for much longer. 
        
  I am a worthless piece of garbage that won't ever be able to amount to anything. I am a failure in the making at 18 and don't want to see how much I struggle to just fail.
     
  And even now I know I'm only doing this in a last ditch effort to feel loved by someone, but please someone tell me why I shouldn't just end it.

EDIT: I will admit telling or rather posting has made me feel a little better but the depression will come back and i end up at square 1 again.. 

I really want to say thank you to those who have reached out to help. The kindness y'all have given has really given me a better perspective on the whole event. I can feel bad but suicide wasn't the right thing to do here.

6085,"Mental illnesses working together to kill meThis time in lockdown has really made me aware of my mental illnesses... less distraction, I’m more alone than I’ve ever been. I suffer from a cocktail of mental demons.  The biggest one is my eating disorder, exercise addiction, anxiety and anger problems, bipolar disorder, and soon I will be tested to see if I have a personality disorder. 

I’ve realized... I’d rather be the one in control of my life and death rather than my mental disorders. My eating disorder will kill me one day, I know it, why wait. My ED has already taken so much from me, why let it take my life. I want that power. I want the control in taking my life, my fate.

I was the first one to know, I was shooting a movie in Asia when his roommate called me saying they found his body hanging in his room. Exact words. Right before shooting an emotional scene, Ive always believed things happened for a reason, but this wasn’t a moment that needed to happen, no matter the reason. It was shocking, no one saw this coming, I guess that’s how a lot of suicides leave us, wondering why we didn’t see the signs, why we didn’t help, what we could’ve done... I’ve never been the same since. I’ve seen first hand how suicide affects so many people,  yet I still battle these thoughts. I’m sorry I know this was all over the place, a ramble of words and improper grammar... my mind is full of thoughts, most of them full of anger and despair. I’m sure no one will read this, perhaps I needed to vent in a place I feel less alone, almost understood. I have no one to talk to about this because I don’t want to be a burden on my family.

My own family harassed me with the Bible because me being a trans woman is sinful and against their religion apparently. 

I'm sick and tired of this world. Just want a way out. I've tried many attempts to only still be alive. Things like hanging or overdosing both failed. People says that I'm only still alive because I have a purpose. Rather, I didn't try hard enough. I'm tired of people saying they care only to be hurtful. 

No, I can't just snap out of it. Someone even told me that I'm only Depressed because I don't bother trying to be happy. Thing is, I rather be dead.

16203,"See myself going nowhere in life. People say ""You're only __ years old, things will get better.""Ohh yea first of all, I'm not a girl, so lots of people might stop reading from this point.

When I was 16 years old I had no friends, never had a girlfriend, had very poor grades, and was unemployed. My life was going nowhere and I could see this was going to continue. I disliked my appearance and height, hoping those things would change as well. People would always say things like ""You're only 16, things will improve for the better,"" and stuff like that.

Fast forward, I'm almost 19 and a half and I have made no progress in life. I have literally no friends, never had a girlfriend, I'm still unattractive and not tall, and my grades are very bad (a solid 2.0) in college. I was very close to losing all my financial aid. I have been going to the gym for 3 years consistently with no progress. I can see that things will never get better even with effort. I am tired of people giving false hope. Age makes things worse if anything.

If I cant get friends, then how can I get a girlfriend? I am a person too, and I am very tired of being alone my entire life. One of my big fears is that ill be mid 20s and still alone. I was alone at 16, 19 and probably the rest of my life, if I live through it. I did manage to get a summer job, and I was always alone while the coworkers were in groups and I was by myself. I am not good looking at all, and I'm sure everything would be better if I were tall and white. I wont ever be able to find someone who likes me for me. My grades can never go up. I don't see myself making any progress in life, and theres no passion for anything. Most of this is because of my low self esteem from being unattractive. Genetics and my low confidence are an issue. I've never asked anyone out either. People don't pay attention to me because of that. Looks are everything. People don't care unless youre rich, dead or good looking. Any advice on how to be good looking, how to get a girlfriend (any way at all), how to get grades up with fear of failing, or how to improve my life in general? Ill take any advice, because things get worse as you get older and I'm sure of that.

3665,"I do not have anything worth living for anymoreI've been beset by a lot of problems/difficulties in my life and there's a part of me that wants to live and there's a part that wants to die. I just want the problems to simply just vanish and never appear again, and my problems have made me lose the will to fight any longer.

Simply put, I have Aspergers. I'm 20 years old, and I think I've just about had it with my life. Yes I've had challenges with my Aspergers condition, yes I have done things that I'm not too proud of, but my parents, teachers and peers alike have subjected me to bitter verbal abuse, humiliation and several uncomfortable situations to make me feel unhappy and upset for who I am. My parents felt I was too difficult to deal with and they continued to literally disown me and subject me to harsh treatment.

Even as I joined a fraternity to escape the harsh treatment, my fraternity brothers have continued to do things to screw me over rather than accept the way I am. They took issue with me not opening up as much and forced me into drinking and coming to their parties, and when I asked them for help with a date to our formal, one of my brothers spread a rumor that I wanted to ask her out.

Everybody and everything wants to be against me so better I do die than to move on with my life. Nobody will understand me, nobody will take me seriously, nobody believes my Asperger's so why bother fighting when every resource that I have used has been exhausted?

I don't want to forgive and I don't want my offenders to rest in peace. This is a terrible world after all; all I have is three options: Suicide, Cope Up, or live with it. Maybe suicide is a better option for me since I'm done with everything.

Maybe life isn't worth it anymore, since I don't have anything to live for. I'm too weak to move on, I'm bleeding with the amount of bullet holes riddled in me because of what people have done to me. I even called the suicide hotline 20-25 times because of my problems, and counseling didn't even help at all.

God did this to me. I just wish he fucking killed me already if he hates me that much that he has to always introduce this shit to me. I just want the pain to go away and never come back again.

283,"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 

So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable. 

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it.

1136,"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 

Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.

Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 

I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?

Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:

\- I'm ugly and overweight

\- I'm shy and introvertic

\- I'm bad at having conversations

\- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)

\- etc.

It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.

For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge.",suicide,"i m nothing and i won t have anything enjoyable in my life firstly, i m sorry for my bad english but i m not a native speaker  so, i m 18 years old boy and i ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months i would probably do it already, if not the fact, that i doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend  maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that well, i would rather ask why shouldn t i? there is no happiness for me, now or in the future i think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man i don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or i just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? there s is not a good thing waiting for me, period  everyone perceive happiness as a different thing for me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy it may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that i have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion maybe that s the reason why i want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that i m not able to do  i was thinking about becoming an writer that s a way, right? people will enjoy my books and everything will be fine well, there s the problem, i m not good enough, to make it work although i enjoy writing, what s the fucking point, if it doesn t reach wider public? secondly, i know it my sound kind of cheesy, but i don t think i can reach happiness without having a girlfriend and, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible there are various reasons for that   i m ugly and overweight   i m shy and introvertic   i m bad at having conversations   i m kind of a weirdo i don t like generic music and stuff   etc  it is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it s so fucking painful, man and it s really not about sex, i don t give a fuck about sex, i can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone it s about love and everything that comes with that  for the end i m just gonna say, wish me, that someday i will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge ",443

The one who told me about it, my sister, said they want to try giving me back control over my life. But they also put a club on my car so that I can't drive anywhere.

I am suffering a lot of indignities right now because of my poor choices. For example, I sleep in the same room as a 3-year-old and have nowhere to put my stuff. Sounds like no big deal, at least I have a place to stay... but it still makes me feel like a child.

I have been unemployed and broke for a while. When my phone was shut off, I missed a call that could have landed me a job. I told my sister and she said I could have asked for help with the phone bill. The only problem is I feel like I have asked for help as directly as I could. That has always been really hard for me, but I told my siblings that I wasn't able to pay my bills and they didn't do jack shit about it.

Now my car's booted and they think I've never reached out and the whole thing is really humiliating.

I really am a whiny bitch when I try looking at myself from the outside... wow. But how can I take this intervention seriously when I have been suffering (more ways than the petty ones I've listed here obviously) for YEARS?

15461,"2 weeks ago on my 19th birthday, i went to sleep with a plastic bag over my head after eating half a bottle of xanax because nothing makes any sense to me.i am still unclear as to how i ended up in hospital and what went wrong, all i know is my dad saved me.

When i was 9-12 i use to have a reoccurring dream that went over my head at the time.

I hope it’s okay to just vent a little here. I tried to end myself in September and failed, landing myself in a psych ward for ten days. I deal with bipolar 1 symptoms, and I was off my meds for a month and that happened. I did everything to plan, including quit my job and even finding a new, better home for my 8 y/o dog. So I lived. And it’s been almost three months and I haven’t even bothered trying to find another job, and I’m about to get kicked out of my place. 

Mostly, I just want to vent about how not having a job and some time to reflect, I’ve accepted key things here. I have never had any passions, goals, dreams, or even one stupid hobby. I never went to school because my parents refused to co-sign loans, and all my relationships with friends have amounted to nothing. I have been working with no educational background, accepting dead end after dead end jobs that I absolutely HATE. I get burned out so fast and over worked, and I’ve NEVER been able to make enough money to live on my own despite working three jobs at one time. I’m so tired. My bf is going back to school, and trying to make something of himself, and all I feel is jealousy and fear of losing him to someone better. 

I genuinely don’t believe that this is just depression anymore. I am seriously a pathetic loser, who desperately tried and even stupidly believed at one point I’d be something, but it’s over for me. I’m 27. I am almost 30. I am a waste. I have nothing to show for my not good enough efforts, and everyone I know to talk to is frustrated with me. My bf says “you have a mental block and you need to change your mindset” but I can’t pick myself back up anymore I simply do not have the energy. I feel so alone while I’m desperately crying out for help and no one is listening. 

I’m on meds. I’m going to therapy weekly but it does nothing. My own therapist doesn’t even know what to say to me she just looks at me like I’m a sad fucking puppy. I’m stupidly crying while typing this out, I’m literally the biggest failure I can’t even kill myself right.

3792,"Dammit...thought I was getting better!!!Sigh. I thought when I was being discharged from the hospital last Wednesday that I could go home and everything would be better. I got home and it was back to the same bullshit that I had tried to kill myself over. The ""funny"" thing is that there isn't anything SPECIFIC that is happening that I can put my finger on and say ""this is why I feel this way!"" Things with my hubby and kids are okay and life has just gone back to the same routines, the same things every day. They aren't bad things. They aren't things that trigger my depression feelings. 

So why the fuck am I still feeling this way? WHY AM I STILL HERE? Gah. Sorry guys. I have no clue what is going on. My depression (even with this new medication) has deepened once again. I am not at the point of suicide though. The medication sort of helps me block out those feelings effectively so I don't try to hang myself or slit my wrists open. I don't WANT to go back to the hospital because that would effectively destroy a marriage that is already shaky because of my last attempt. That would send it over the edge and I don't want to go there. I really don't feel the urge to kill myself anyhow (a good thing!) but I can't help thinking that I really wish I HAD died when I overdosed. I wish I had been successful. :(

Good grief. I am pissed off because I can't cut anymore. That would also destroy things. If my hubby or kids saw cuts again (especially this soon after getting out of the hospital) he would leave me in a heartbeat. 

So...what am I left with? Frustration. Sadness. Deep deep depression. Anxiety. 

I can't eat...and I won't eat now. I had gained 5 lbs. in the hospital and now...I am losing all of that and some. I am hungry all the time and I don't give a shit. I like the pain of the hunger anyhow. It is comforting to me. I wish I could lose faster and be 100 lbs. already.

I need to go now. I have rambled on quite enough and I am having a hard time focusing on the screen again.

Sorry to whine here, but I have nowhere else to turn. 

I thought I was done with SuicideWatch...but I guess not...

If I need to go, just tell me. I am not suicidal per say...just...lost?

6245,"Love: Lost in TranslationHi everyone.

I am a nineteen (19) year old college student in North America and my thought pattern of suicide edged itself thoroughly in my mind. I have been currently attending one-on-one counseling sessions, I am scheduled to attend a psychiatric evaluation tomorrow, Monday, February 20th; I have practiced meditation, and I disclosed my thoughts to two of my friends but...I don't feel it.

Yes, when my friends ask me, ""what would you do if a meteorite struck me and *I* suddenly died?"" I conjure up a generic response flavored with succulent adjectives. For example, ""oh! I would uncontrollably quiver in a world of shock!"" or something similar.

I love my friends. I love my family. I wish no harm unto others. And I believe my suicide would result in further emotional strengthening and dynamic character understanding qualities of those I love and have not met.

This excludes me. I do not love myself. Reasons for my self-intolerance range from physical attributes to inappropriate mental thoughts to what I eat for breakfast; all of it is despicable. 

Do others in this community feel similarly? Have others experience that *heart-wrenching invigoration* for people, but not themselves? Hearing my close friend Alice (a pseudonym) contemplate even the insignificant -- like her disgust caused by eyeing a fellow customer in the gelato line wearing a red and black plaid shirt with blue and green plaid shorts -- highlights my week.

The night seeps in, however, I am left with myself. Every night, I recognize the fact I lack the intellectual discipline to maintain sufficient grades, I recognize the fact I lack the physical attributes of an attractive person, I recognize the fact I lack the communication skills to chat with friends, I recognize the fact the fact I lack love for myself, I recognize the fact the fact I do not *want* to love myself.

A ""suicide gesture"" -- as my counselor calls them -- occupied my last Friday night. Forty minutes of me walking in middle class suburbia towards freight-train railroad tracks and squirming to find a seat on a freshly cut tree stump represents my ""suicide gesture."" In nineteen (19) years, the one last Friday marks number four (4).

My thoughts are scattered -- I apologize for my in-cohesive writing. I am going to try medication if my psychiatric evaluation deems it necessary, however, I ultimately want to be liberated from school responsibilities and financial responsibilities and even dental hygiene responsibilities. Mostly, I want liberation from a mind that has consistently scowled and insulted my existence. I want to kill myself.

9159,"I'm falling so very far so very very fast.I know pain is temporary. I know what I'm facing will one day subside, but I feel so alone. My support is nothing but ice. If I make one wrong step I lose. I mean I seriously lose. I lose my stuff. It gets sold with my fathers house and put into the inheritance which is then divided. All because I can't manage to get a job. I've broken down weeping three times in the last 24 hours because I don't know what to do. I'm so tired, so drained, so alone and exhausted. I can't fucking navigate this goddamn ice drift that is my SUPPORT. Not life, my fucking support is the most treacherous aspect in my life. Especially when each fucking step, no matter how in the right direction I take, makes the ice groan and crack beneath me. 

I have a life line in the necessities but no money to pay debts. A lifeline is not support though, it's just there to make sure I don't drown right away. I have no job because I quit due to it partially driving me to try and kill myself in March. If by June I don't come up with some solution I don't know what I'll do but suicide is looking like a very viable option. I know how I'll do it. BUt the only help I'm getting I had to fucking find, and I have to fucking pay for. I can't do it anymore. I don't want to do it anymore. All my coping skills are failing me. They help me regain composure, they help me deal with the moment, they don't help with the pain. The pain which is just building and building and building. 

I don't want to go back to a hospital. I don't want to find a job. I want to get better. I want to heal. I want to feel like life is worth something. I've been trying so hard but it's never enough. It's never enough to ease the pain, or to satisfy my fucking support. I miss my dad. I feel so utterly defeated, so utterly alone in this tempest. I don't know how to cry out for help either because it feels like every time I do it isn't heard. I feel my back being pressed into a corner. A corner I don't want to be in, but I refuse to fall lower. I'll choose death.

12775,"My StoryI was born in the fall of '89 a bastard and the youngest of 4. Bought with a case of Coors and some chewing tobacco. My mother ended up marrying an abusive, drunk, meth addict. He would beat us, spit, golden shower, basically anything else you could imagine. We lived in a one bedroom trailer with 8 dogs, infested with cockroaches. Never had food. One day my sister got tired of it and went to the cops, we got taken away when I was 8 and thrust into foster care. My early years were spent jumping from home to home until one day I found out I'll not be going back with my mom. She chose the abuser and signed over her rights.

From there my life took a spiral, I started acting out to the point I had to go into a mental hospital at 12. Then it was group home after group home. Finally at 17 I got emancipated from the state. Becoming my own guardian. I first tried to find my mom, only to be disappointed that she didn't change and was still with said abuser. I was homeless, so were they. I couch hopped where I could. Did a lot of drugs to numb myself. I was alone, no one wanted to take me in. Why was I even alive? My birth dad was dead. My mother chose a piece of shit over me. I had no goals or future prospects. I was alone.

I decided to overdose on dramamine (motion sickness pills). I took two full vials. Ended up in jail, they found me disoriented and naked, unable to speak. They saved my life but I wasn't thankful.

I ended up getting released on an obstruction charge, time served. That night I was walking alone when I stopped by a tree and broke down. Letting 19 years of anger out at God at one time. That's when it all changed for me. Next thing I knew, I was on a bus headed to the other side of the country with no clue what I was doing. Then I met my wife. She convinced her mom to let me move in. I got a job, took care of the cleaning. Had my first child. Now I'm 29, with two kids, I've been married for 5 years and work as a caregiver for the disabled.

9170,"PlanningShort story. 17 year old student, am bipolar (taking pills for emotional stability) have battled deppression for a long time (for me atleast) i am a perfectionist, i am a germophobe, my main sin is pride. All through my life, i have been denied. Love? I am hopeless, i have been friendzoned and denied. I have never had a girlfriend yet i lost my virginity to a girl who manipulated me and tricked me to then leave me. I have been good at everything in school until now, my memory is starting to fail and my first failed test started some month ago. I started cheating on that test like everyone else. I started to get near F tests more and more. For each time my confidence sank, now it may not sound like a big deal, but in my brain? Its everything, i want to be special, perfect, better than those who fail. I have layed down countless of hours crying, i have thought countless times on how i should hang myself, yet each time i think for myself ""what about my mom? She is deppressed already and she will kill herself if i do"" that has stopped me alot. But right now, i have no feelings. We had a national test today, i planned it, even though i had 5 other tests and assignements. Everything was perfect, yet when i came up to the stage, i couldnt say anything. The speech was to be 3 minutes long or i would fail, it was 1 minute long. I stuttered, i couldnt come up with anything, i was panicking. Everyone else passed, the failed students too. I thought to myself with confidence, ""i have everything planned, the cord, everything"" i dont know if i care anymore. I am scared but i need to do this, i cant handle things anymore. My life has been a big failure, i have not achieved a single thing. I dont know why i am writing this, maybe to calm myself, maybe to realize something, this sounds like a novell, but its not. I want to hang myself, but i am afraid, i usually neglect any advice of any kind, i dont know why. Its just who i am. What should i do?

13504,"little bit of rambling i guesssLast year has been the one and only time where i was in a very, i guess, ""heated"" moment, where i was very close to getting a knife and stabbing myself. I felt really fucking horrible, can't really describe the feeling. Killing myself would've been the best option in that moment. Obviously, i didn't do it.

From then to now, i still have these thoughts every once in a while. I'm actually in a situation where killing myself wouldn't be very difficult (emotionally speaking). I don't have any/a big attachment to my family, for example, so, as selfish as it sounds, i don't care how it would affect them. My mom would be sad, i think, since she doesn't really know about any of this, but she's the most rational person i know, so i'm sure she'd get over it. My few friends would most likely also be able to move on. But generally, (again, you can call me selfish) it's my life so i wouldn't care that much how it would affect anyone i know.

Yeah. I don't know. I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do.

The thing is, i'd say i'm quite young and i always thought to myself that before i decide to commit suicide, i want to see what else the world holds and if it'd be worth it to keep living. But i just don't see the reason in (my) life. And my main problem just can't be fixed. I think i'd have to wait with suicide anyways, at least until i live somewhere else, since i'm not really able to act out my preferred method in my country. 

I already sort of have a direction for the job i wanna have once i'm older. I think it would give me a distraction from the main thing i was talking about (i don't really want to mention it). Don't know if i'll make it or if i'll even like it, but i guess it's better than not having a plan at all.

All of this shit suddenly came within a year, i've been the same age from when it started to now. I'm just a bit afraid what'll happen once i'm older? If I can suddenly feel this way in just a year, how bad is it gonna be in the future?

Right now I feel like im going through hell with no return. Half the time I don’t recognise myself anymore in the mirror and I’m scared of what I see at times. Who knows what everyone else thinks of me. My life has been really grey for the past year and half now and I guess I don’t know what to do anymore. I have told my parents I want to die. They have taken me to the doctors. I have been given meds to help me sleep but I refuse to continue taking them because it will make things worse in the long run. But I’m kind of glad I was given pills so I have an easy and painless way out if I have to.
There is a multitude of things wrong with me for me to feel the way I do. I feel absolutely obliged to feel this way because I’m always in pain. If I wasn’t feeling this way, I wouldn’t be human. I feel like complete shit, washed up trash. I used to be such a happy kid when I was 13-14. But ever since then an evil has grown within me eating me inside and out. I started feeling like this from year 9 or so onwards. What happened in year 9 was I met someone who I liked at first. And honestly I didn’t realise he was my poison for me. I started having late nights playing games because of him. And watching porn and doing you know what every day because of him. He showed me these bad habits and now its fucked me up. I honestly feel I need serious help. I’m generally scared my well-being every day. I try to put on a brave face or smile in public but it’s all to mask what I’m feeling. My face is covered with blotches of red and pimples now. And my eyes feel like sand whenever I’m outside in the wind or the air con is blazing. My face is greyish and sunken almost as well. This is mainly around my eyes because I have to rub them vigorously.
Anyway. I have posted to this thing before. Didn’t really help. I’m posting again for the last time to seek help before I end eat. If you know anything about whats wrong with me and how to reverse it. Please tell me. God help me.

11436,"Don’t mind me just ranting about some stuff. Not safe for the easily offended left winger. Ok. I’ll start this off by saying that I in no way am a racist. Not. At. All. I believe that EVERY life matters, born or unborn. And I’ll say it upfront I’m pretty much your average republican. Pro life pro gun pro police the works. So if that offends you then move on to the next post cause you’re in for a doozy. My parents raised me to be a free thinker. And I’ve done just that. I have taken fact and logic and formed opinions. Therefore, my views can be swayed using ONLY facts and logic. On to the point. 
I just saw a post saying that blue lives don’t matter because a blue life isnt a thing but a black life is. Saying that a blue life is a career choice but you can’t choose to be black. And yes. Black lives matter. But so do white ones. So do Asian ones. Korean. Mexican. Spanish. Name the nationality, their life matters. But here’s what ticks me off. 
People take one bad experience and crucify the lot of the group for it. One shooting and suddenly all guns are bad. Yes. Shooting are awful and should never happen but the only thing stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. So there’s that. 
And I really hate the hate I see being thrown at our nations cops. And I’m not saying that all cops are saints. Or that racism doesn’t exist anymore. I’m saying that we don’t need change to the system as much as people say we do. I’m saying that the ones calling door CHANGE, don’t want CHANGE. They want CONTROL. The same thing happened to the military way back when. People were hating and spitting on soldiers coming home from hellholes in Korea and Vietnam. It’s nothing new. But it sickens me. I hate it. “Just turn off your computer you right wing racist” no you have the right to disagree with me. But the moment somebody tries to take my rights because another abused them, we will have a problem. 
Guys please understand that I don’t know everything and I know that. But facts and logic have basically gone out the window when it comes to the left, and if you’re TRULY open minded you’d see that. So all I ask is if you’re going to crucify me, use facts and logic from your own research not CNN articles.

15452,"""Hey man, how's life."" A text from my friend on the 5th I never got around to replying to. Found out today he killed himself in his dorm room.I met him while working at a local grocery store.  He was one of my favorites to work with because he was a hard reliable worker and we always managed to get on wild tangents of conversation that made the day much more enjoyable. He was just finishing up his senior year in high school where he was one of several valedictorians and worked until later in the summer when he left to study chemistry.

One of his last days at work he came over to my house and I dumped something around 10 gigs of music on his computer for him to help with all the kicking ass he was about to embark on at college.  He seemed so thrilled to be starting this new chapter of his life, and I was happy for him.  He was so logical and mature for his age but still so young and naive.  He would often ask about my college exploits, the parties, the girls.  I didn't embellish the details and was rather blunt about my over the top approach to life and my struggle with alcohol.  I tried my best to be a mentor of sorts and pass on some of my hindsight and experience.

I have no idea what lead him to take his own life or what clues he may have been leaving in how he lived his last days, weeks, or months.  We only caught up randomly once in a while and the news from him always seemed to be of wild enthusiasm and enjoyment, perhaps a clue in itself.  He did have a lot of built up sense of incomplete social goals having been so dedicated to school. 

I worried he might be going a little hard on the partying, but I and so many others of us did the same thing in college. 

It hurts wondering if he was reaching out to me with that last text message... I know he was in some way.

Any of you out there struggling please realize that no matter your misery, embarrassment, loneliness, or anything that compels you to think in terms of suicide, people care about you and are willing to help you as much as they can.

466,"I'm heading back into that direction...Sorry about the length.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

14817,"the best life has to offerI got diagnosed with bipolar and depression when I was 8. it made sense at the time, I had a pretty shitty life. fortunately since I'm canadian therapy and meds were free. unfortunately the only thing therapy ever did for me was make me aware of the fact that suicide was a thing and i never stopped thinking about it since. my meds didnt do much so they stopped giving them to me after a while. no one knew what the fuck was wrong with me. I didnt know anything either, all i knew was that i didnt want to live. the only thing that kept me going was what my doctor would always say:

""don't leave a situation before making sure you've seen it all. don't kill yourself before your sure you've lived your life to the fullest""

this part might sound like the hopeful part but it's not. life got a lot less shitty over time. I'm 17 now. I'm more than sure I've seen the best life has to offer. my family loves me very much, we have more than enough money, I have lots of friends, I can almost get any guy that I want if I try, I'm healthy, and when i look at the life other people around me are living..I realize how lucky I am. It really can't get any better than this

but I'm still miserable, even more maybe. I don't care about money, I don't care about my friends or any people, I don't want to deal with the responsibility of my family loving me. no one still knows what the fuck is wrong with me, I still dont know anything and I still don't want to live. maybe life's just never meant for some people? theres always a error, mutation in at least one of the models of anything to ever exist.

I get frequent headaches and always think I'm dying, but I really do feel like shit except no one believes it, they think I'm nuts, again I can't blame them. A lot more but I'm tired of writing.

Just looked at the ex's FB pic, she is beautiful as ever. I hope her life is happy. I know I could never have brought it to her. I bet she isn't alone today.

5891,"My mind is my worst enemy.Hello whoever(if anyone)is reading this, I'm having trouble actually putting into words how I feel, So I'm going to just write as it comes to me, I apologize if it's difficult to follow.


I feel so empty, not entirely void of feelings, more like everything I experience comes through a buffer, Like I'm not entirely *here* or *there*. 

I have trouble feeling emotions like other people do, I rarely laugh, I'm browsing reddit all of the time, and things that are obviously so funny to everyone just don't effect me. Even things that seem heart-wrenching to everyone else, barely scratch the surface of my ""heart"". It's like everything is watered down. 

I recently dropped out of high school, At first it was a huge relief, but now that it's been nearly 2 months since dropping out and I've done nothing more than piss time away on reddit.

Suicide has crossed my mind, But I feel like life is just so valuable, and a person can do so many great things that to end a life, even mine, as useless as I feel I am, is wasteful. I want to believe that things can get better, But I just feel like I don't have a future. Of course everyone has a *future*, but I'm afraid that mines isn't one worth having.

My memory is horrible, I retain very little of the information I learn. I always tell myself that if I were normal, like everyone else, I'd actually appreciate learning, and the company of other people, but I just don't. 

I feel like I'm incompetent. I never have anything insightful to say, I rarely have anything at all to contribute to anything, Ever. I really wish I could think of myself as an intellectual, but I just can't. Does an intelligent person struggle to manage their thoughts? Does a person that is not hopelessly stupid forget what they were thinking about only seconds after having started the thought? 

Spending time online let's me escape reality for a short time, but inevitably at the end of the day I have to live with my self.

I've had this bottled up for so long, and I'd like to think that getting it off my chest feels good, But really, I don't feel different at all.

I have a couple friends online but I wouldn't feel comfortable opening up to them.

I really just want someone to talk to.

15106,"HospitalizationJust curious on ya'lls thoughts on hospitalization. I checked myself in a week ago because my racing thoughts were killing me. I'm out after a week feeling just as suicidal, but I'm feeling more guilty because of all the support I got and the people who came to visit. I thought I'd gotten better, but now that I'm out I feel just as much like dying if not more so.

The staff were very supportive and caring, the time away from the world was good, but the fact that I was one of the few people who was a first time hospitalization, with many having multiple stints, the debriefing largely consisted of ""remove all harmful materials from your home, call the suicide hotline, or 911 in an emergency, and talk to someone if you have suicidal thoughts"" suggests to me they aren't that effective.

I'm fortunate I never got the ""it gets better"" speech (I think my condition is very troubling to people, they don't know how to deal with non-situational suicidal urges), but it seems like mental health is about not dying, rather than about helping us feel like we don't want to die. Also, group therapy was not helpful. I have recurring thoughts that NEED to go away, and learning to notice bipolar triggers or expressive movement/art therapy don't suction out my bad thoughts.  More often you get the ""what to do in a crisis/how to cope"" approach rather than a ""let's heal your pain"" approach. I get why, it's hard to help someone heal, and the coping skills help people with their symptoms when they show up, but I honestly have no interest in living with the pain I have, no matter how good my life gets to compensate. 

Hospitalization  only makes more nervous about talking about suicide, because I refuse to be admitted again, and I don't know how to tell my friends and family that this didn't work, I'm probably not going to survive much longer. I wish they had like a thought eraser, wipe my mind clean of the bad thoughts. Hell I'd take complete amnesia if I could, forget everything just to make the disturbing thoughts stop. But until they invent that, I'm not sure I like hospitalization as a treatment tool for many suicidal people. I think it helped me deal with Schizophrenia, but that has little to do with my desire to not live.

9,"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime.

5407,"At what point is it better to die than to live this way?I've been struggling with this condition for 8 months now, with no sign of recovery.

90% of my waking life my mind is blank: completely devoid of mental activity. It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness. Additionally, my short term and long-term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and (simply put) think are at an atrociously low level. My brain has a complete absence of mental activity. This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain; but almost all the time my mind is completely blank, like a zombie. In a sense, I’m mentally catatonic, like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb: just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness. Every moment I’m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness. When not stimulated by loud music, video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I “zone out.” My mind is completely empty; there is no thought whatsoever. 

This brings me to my memory issues (both short and long term); trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort. Sometimes I'll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch, but memories are scattered and non-linear. Trying to remember something that happened a day ago, a week ago, or a year ago feels the same. There is just no clarity of memory.

 I feel perpetually ""spaced out"", my mind feels foggy, as though I'm in a dream or under the influence of some substance. I feel awake yet not awake, sleepy although im physically fully awake. I have trouble with social interaction because I just don't know what to say most of the time. Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response, just to look normal because otherwise there'd be nothing I have to say. The times I do have something to speak up on, I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence. There are times where I'll just mentally blank out mid-utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next. I feel like I'm just existing in this one moment, with no past, no connection to the present, and no future.

6029,"Im not sureI really want to kill my self right now. I am slowly becoming more and more nihilistic as time goes on and its eating me alive. I'm always thinking about my own death and the only time i'm not is when i am distracted by some activity.  


All i can hear is a feedback loop of my insecurities and fears. I've been randomly going out on walks in the middle of the night and just wandering around because sitting at home by myself is just too hard to bare and the walk normally distracts me. I've been trying to look at everything objectively and trying to stop instinctive thoughts. And objectively everything is fucking aids. Everything everywhere is going down the shitter and to say it isn't just means your exaggerating the positives and ignoring the negatives.

The after life *spoookkky*

but seriously the after life is terrifying the idea of an infinite life scares me because whats the point in death if the after-life is infinite,even if the after life wasn't infinite what would the end look like. And what first comes to mind is nothing but that's hard to comprehend. Feeling nothing is some thing that isn't possible unless you were totally unself-aware but us as humans aren't and even tho these may not be the deepest thoughts ever they still make me feel even worse. Its almost as if what ever i do makes me more depressed.

Not too long ago, i left a jacket at my friends house and his mum found a razor and called the school. My parents found out about self harm, but i hated attention from it and this didn't help this so i swiftly found alternatives to cutting. The school didn't seem to mind and just forwarded me to some therapy thing that really doesn't help at all. The group therapy thing seemed to focus more on anxiety caused depression as i assume that's a common trend with teens who self harm. 

Its like there's some thing stopping me from being happy. I got a new room this week, new desk and its so much better than sharing a room with my step brother and still here i am wanting to die.

I seem to be a walking contradiction. Here i am wanting to die yet here i am still alive. I say i'm a nihilist and don't care and here i am breaking down over every inconvenience.

9677,"Women are afraid of expressing their sexuality.Where I live, women are forced not to express their sexuality. I am not gonna go around bullshitting on the country I live or the culture. But I've had enough with the way most of them treats women. Let's consider the case of a rape victim, If the victim is someone that doesn't dress or live up to their social norms, what happened to them was their mistake. The lady deserved to be sexually assualted for wearing revealing clothing or going out at night. She literally asked for it by intentionally enabling themselves to be in a situation like that. You're a living, breathing human and you're bound to enjoy sexuality as much as men does. But your gender makes you sl*t, sex before marriage is a sin, women aren't meant to have multiple sexual partners, this is what I've heard and been taught my entire life. 

Yesterday, I shared an image of two couple from the new Netflix film The Old Guard on my Instagram story, and my ex boyfriend literally just called and yelled this to me ""Do you really know how everyone perceives a women who shares pictures of gay dudes on social media? Quit proving everyone you're a who*e."" Seriously, the picture I shared was in no way sexually suggestive. It was simply a picture of two guys I found adorable and he went on to dig the entire plot and came off attacking me. I know this makes no sense, but that's how things go around where I live. I personally don't have problem with people with having multiple partners in the past aslong they're not being unfaithful and is in no risk of transmitting STDs. But once the word goes out that you're not a virgin and had two or more sexual partners, bravo you just made to the sl*t list! You're no longer bound to have a family, friends or to be respected. In general, their so called sl*ts doesn't deserves to have a decent life, despite doing nothing but enjoying their sexuality. Even the emotionally manipulated, blackmailed ones aren't considered 'victims' in front of the society. Revenge porn, leaking illicit contents are all well appreciated because a girl chose to end relationship with a guy. Even if someone's cheating or had enough with a relationship, no one deserves to have their private images and videos upload on the internet for someones sick pleasure.

11305,"Not strong enough.I always thought of committing suicide but I don't think it ever hit me as hard as today. I can't even feel sadness at this point, I am just really angry at everything. Nothing makes me happy anymore, it hasn't for years. I can't blame others for something I chose though so I am angry at myself as well. I can't even be honest because I see how they look at me afterwards. I try so hard to keep it to myself and hold it all in but I wonder much longer I can take...

In the end, I can only blame myself for my constant silly choices in life ever since I was a child so I have to live with their consequences.

Or maybe it's karma for mistreating and scaring away those around me. But then again if I can't love myself how can I love others? I would just be lying to everyone, which is still what I do to avoid unecessary drama. People tell me I am cold and cruel but how can a person be so cold and yet feel so bad about themselves?

I have no problem admitting I messed up, it's just that even if I admit, there is no point to it, nothing will change. What's done is done. I can hardly even look at people in the eyes for as long as I remember.

Why am I the one who is very healthy? I'm doing nothing here.

15718,"I feel like I am going through a crisis related to mortality, which is leading me to insanity.I am 23, currently an accounting student expected to get my bachelor degree next year. It's going to take me 1.5 years longer than what it's supposed to, and this is the first contributing factor to the way I feel.

During the last three and a half years of university, I have achieved many things I am proud of. I became manager of a large student associatiob, I founded my own non profit company with some friends (although we cannot make any profits, so it's not a real job) and I managed to bank five years of job experience working as an accountant in my family business.

This sounds great, and it is. However, I am slowly losing my mind.

My family is a wreck. My mother suffers from borderline personality disorder and has narcissistic tendencies: she attempted suicide by sleeping pills overdose a few years back, and pointed a pair of scissors to my neck when I was 13. I have been to therapy just to elaborate this memory, which haunts me to this day. 

I cannot keep living in this house. My mother is getting more insane as times goes on.

A few months back, I lost my job. That completely devastated me, as it was my only source of income. We are poor, and it's not like my dad gives me money. 

Then problems in the association started to arise. People leaving, badmouthing others, and a bunch of other stuff.

I couldn't pass any exam, I am far behind my schedhle for graduation, and last week, after the last crisis in the association, I broke down. I got a ""nervous fever"" as the doctor called it: my temperature spiked up to 41.5° and I was hospitalized for the night. My body and mind have suffered to much stress it nearly killed myself.

I have two problems.

1) The association. I can't continue to be president. As soon as my phone rings, I assume things have good wrong and there is a problem I have to fix. I literally shake when I get a notification. I also cannot leave though, because I was elected, and leaving would cause the group to fall.

2) My age. I would be 26 if I decide to continue and get my master's degree. That's way too much time to spend at home with my mother.

4199,"I Truly Hate LivingObligatory I'm on mobile, so format will be unadulterated trash, as well as this is decently lengthy, get a snack.


I cannot remember a single day of my pitiful existence being remotely enjoyable. Every memory seems to be, at best, apathy. At worst, my memories are filled with contempt. Even my dreams are plagued with a call to the proverbial void.


Between the excessive feeling of self hatred, loneliness, failure, mental disarray, and overall depression, I'm beginning to have the wonderful nag of self termination (I'd say suicide but let me be a bit avant garde, that word began to bore me with time). Each day feels dreadfully extended. Every second is filled with a feeling I could almost describe as regret to my birth. It certainly does not help that I cannot connect with other people. 


I have friends, had friends, and will have friends, but, they all feel so 2 dimensional. As if I can only observe them and not interect(if that is a clear description of the phenomena). Because of this looming emotional flaw, I will never have a relationship that feels gratifying for the sake of love. Never can I be involved in romance, as I am incapable of expressing depth of such a remarkable emotion. To those who can or do still love, whether superficially or deeply, cling to such a miracle. 


I only fail in school. My motivation erodes with every second, leaving me nothing more than a disappointment whom steadily adds to debt. What was I thinking, engineering is for those who seek a better world, I want to escape it. With each failure, I see more reason to flee from my self created hell. 


If only I could properly type the details of my suffering, it is all too existential to describe in clarity. Let it be known, in my few moments of lucidity, I demand my death from myself. Purpose never having existed, happiness but a fleeting memory, and suffering all encompassing, the only bulwark against my imminent display of cranial ballistic testing is a macabre curiosity of tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day.

11236,"I lost a future friend, dont do this to anyone.One week ago I sent a mail to somebody I wanted to get to know. He never had to chance to open it.

This fall I enrolled in uni. Kinda lonely, but w/e. Everybody is. Have my usual friend circle so everything is okay. Some of my subjects (CS) require student reference group members, and after none of us wanted to do it for this one glass, one guy did. He looked kinda shy in his profile picture but he wrote in a fun way and seemed to be a enjoyable guy, with friends hanging out with him in his banner on facebook. Every 3 weeks they were required to take in feedback from the rest of us and pass on to the lecturer, and he always wrote in a funny snippet for each google poll he would submit. One week ago I wanted the lecturer to go over a certain topic again, as myself and others were struggling with it. I could've just sent the mail myself directly to the lecturer, but the the guy('Joe') seemed fun so I sent him a message and asked him to ask for me. 3 days passed and I didnt get a reply from him, I assumed he forgot it. I then decided to send that mail myself, to the lecturer and got a reply instantly.

Today, I received an email from the school faculty.
'Greg' had passed away the day before before I sent that email. It was never read. I was shocked.

Why?

I went on his page and his mother had written an obituary. I was heartbroken. He was always smiling in every picture, and seemed like a really enjoyable guy. His youtube channel was linked on his instagram, and he was subscribed to alot of the same channels I was, and looked to like alot of the same games aswell. He even had his MyAnimeList on there, the mad lad liked alot of the same stuff I did...

I am so bummed out right now, I never even knew him besides reading his 'obligatory' posts on our student facebook page. We would've had so much to talk about...

So please, if you are on this subreddit for the wrong reasons dont do it. If I feel like this I cant even fathom how those that actually knew him, and were in those pictures with him smiling alongside him feel right now.

I've dealt with weight issues my entire life, constantly getting berated by my family for as long as I can remember. I've tried a lot of weight loss plans throughout my life but to no avail. I always seem to lose motivation after a couple weeks. My weight always seems to be the hot topic at every family gathering, which made me self-conscious about my weight and very quiet at family gatherings. Everyone in my family constantly gives me ""tips"" on how to lose weight, but none of them worked for me, and hearing them for the 1000th time really irritated me. I know at the end of the day, my family means well and they wish the best for me, but making fun of me and making me feel unwanted trying to make me lose fat is really putting me down.

6230,"A temporary solutionI hate how people say that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problem. Because yes, the first half is true. Suicide is permanent. 
But the second half? It makes me laugh somberly.
Everyone in my life who has been suicidal at all, have been suicidal from a young age. And they're in their 20's and 30's. When we talk about suicide, it's something that maybe  they don't think about everyday. Yes, there's bad days and good days. But when they have to fight the rising nothingness that threatens to consume them, it gets harder. You're a little more weary after every fight, year after year, of trying to justify putting yourself through the pain of living. That the color just leaks out of everything and the world turns a little more grey and lifeless. 
Yes, there are some temporary problems out there. But for us, our problems stem from something bigger. And they don't always go away. The need to fight is always there, you have to fight to feel something, fight to stay sober, fight to have the energy to go to work or to school or go out to the fucking grocery store. It's a never ending fight, they tell me. Fighting the bad thoughts in your head never stops, and you have to keep going through the motions until it's easier some days. But no matter how much easier it gets, the bad days are there. No matter how much you try to learn to love yourself. The thing working against you is you after all.
Therapists tell me the same thing: that I will always struggle with my mental health but I just can't give up! Temporary problems and all that.
When they say ""temporary problems"" I wonder how temporary they are. My life will end eventually, so my problems will end too. In the grand scheme of things, yes my problems are incredibly temporary and silly and my struggle is meaningless.
Will my whole life be a ceaseless fight? Will I be hurting myself clawing for life for years and years and years before I turn 50 and realize that it wasn't worth the stress and pain of living that long? Of trying that hard?

11193,"I’ve fucked myself.I’ve made very poor decisions in life that led me to where I am right now. Depressed and suicidal. 

For starters, I dropped out of high school and haven’t taken my GED yet. I doubt I’ll pass it because I’m retarded when it comes to everything other than the writing/english portion. I feel like a failure. 

I moved from NYC to FL to be with some asshole guy who manipulates me and makes me feel broken. I want to leave but it’s not that easy for multiple reasons. If I had a car, (don’t even have a license) I’d pack all my shit and just go. I can’t possibly bring all my things and my cat on a plane with me and I really want to take my shit because at this point, I have nothing back at my mom’s place in NY. I gave away/took everything. 

I don’t have a job for a couple reasons I won’t get into. Bottom line is I can’t start working until a couple months from now. And even when I do, I’ll be pissed off because minimum wage here is nearly half of what it was in NYC. And I made way more there because I worked at a high end salon. every product I sold was $50 in cash that day. I had a great job and I fucking quit it for something stupid. 

My mom’s made some stupid mistake that resulted in me losing my insurance that used to cover therapy. I can’t get fucking therapy anymore or anything I need because she did something really really stupid but it’s too much to get into right now. 

I quit my antidepressants cold turkey 5-6 months ago. I don’t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

I used to have an eating disorder. Still fucks with me to this day even though I’m “recovered” and I lost my entire support system. my boyfriend thinks I’m being ridiculous whenever I talk about it. real comforting. 

I’m a girl, I feel like since I’ve been down in the dumps, I haven’t taken care of my appearance at all. I feel ugly. 

My only solace is writing. I’m almost done with a novel that I’ve been relentlessly working on for years. That’s all I have. After that, I don’t know what to do. And since I’ve been so fucking depressed, I can’t make out any good work anymore.

13525,"So tired.Lately I've been so tired and angry. I have been finding myself sleeping for longer than 10+ hours at a time, and even eating less than I did back in high school.

 I'm an introvert by nature.  At work i have been getting a do-able schedule (by my standards), but then they keep changing my shifts without letting me know. Only 4 other people know how to work in my position at my store, but we just dont have the payroll to overlap shifts. I've been trying to get out of that position for over 3 months now, but they just cant seem to find someone who can take those shifts.

 I am getting so sick and tired of having to ""be nice"" to potential clients, and cleaning up messes from my co-workers, and even then, needing to deal with co-workers who expect the world from me. Every time I try to put my foot down to someone who wants something, I constantly get undermined by a manager. I've been promised a pay raise, and a yearly pay inscrease, but at this point I really don't know if it's worth it.

I really want to quit working for a while, but I need the money from my job so that I can save up and go to college/get a liscence/car. 

I know that if I kill myself right now that I wont have to worry about any of that. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself a while back is because of what it might do to my mom. I cant stand to think of how bad she might get. I may not show it physically and obviously , but she is my world. 

I know that it is wrong of me to feel this, but even I dont have enough connection with my friends to make them another reason not to end myself. I don't care if I leave them with the aftermath, but I just cant do it to my mother.

When I do decide to finally end it, I want to be able to end it in a way that they wont be able to bring me back. I don't want to saddle my family with the burden of paying medical expenses, or force them into he feeling of helplessness and hope, that I may one day come out of a coma.

Than she really can't understand why I want nothing to do with her, and why my kids don't even know she's their grandmother. None of his family cares what he does to  us. He has  absoutley no realtionship at all with these kids, the 1 year old wouldn't even know he's her father if she saw him.

426,"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

1453,"I feel numbI'm the person people go to if no one else is available, and I can't blame them. All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better.

7135,"About a year ago, I commited Suicide. Here's my experience.Idk if I can post this. Please remove and tell me which subreddit to post to.

Aug 21, 2019 I jumped from 5th floor. Very Crtitical for 3 days. But, after 3 months of extensive treatment and post health care, I am now doing fine.

There were many reasons why I did that, But almost All of them involved something , some WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME to not happen. Literally every second, every day of my life prior to that, I lived in Fear. Every second. Nope, didn't want to live like that.

My hospitalization was not smooth. Critical case, eh? You know all poop stuff. wow. Not Cool. But here's something that I experienced for that first time in my life. ""Facing your Fear.""

There is something about ""Facing your absolute fucking God Awful Fear"". I mean we don't just feel fear for fun right? There is always a reason, a Very Worst Possible Outcome. Am I saying the worst outcome will not happen and everything just magic into good if You face you Fears?  **NO**. But, Whatever the fucking outcome is, ONCE THE WHOLE THING IS DONE. GOOD OR BAD OR NEAUTRAL. *The amount of relief, or weight being lifted of you. or You finally able to Breathe Properly for the first time and..wiredly, an iirresistable small smile that your face makes? **HolyFuckingShit**. ***That is worth Living the Life for***.

I don't regret my decision. I don't beat myself for what I did. It wasn't my fault. People say suicide is ""coward way out"" Idk about this, I have never did anything in my life of  *that sorts of courage*, idk if its right word. My only tiny regret is if I used this amount of courage to actually my fears, atleast ONE, maybe I would have thought different.

One at a time. I don't give a flying fuck if you take Two Full years just to form a habit of 'waking up early'. You did it. You are already making progress. I don't care if the progress is Slow. As long as you are trying, even a little bit, That's Good. You can sleep with content. Just give shit time, ALOT of time if it demands.

9548,"I've had suicidal ideations for over a decade. I think I'm going to kill myself in a week.I've gone to psychologists and psychiatrists, therapists of all levels of legitimacy. I've written poems and prose about it, read books, meditated, spontaneously gone on vacations to Europe to try to enjoy life, met people, made new friends, fallen in love. I have what should by all measures be a pretty good life, but I have been terrible, oppressively miserable since I was about 10 or 11.

I've been on more medication than I could possibly relay to you, and the only conclusion I've been able to make is that my brain chemistry is stubbornly fucked. 

I'm not manic. I'm not even upset about it. I'm generally a rational, level-headed, intelligent person. I don't want this to be a rash decision. I just think it's time to give up, because I've spent a very long time hoping things will get better, and they've been stagnant.

I have friends, but I've considered it at length and I don't believe this will seriously affect any of them. I've been abroad extensively, and most of them are used to me being gone and have either adjusted or moved on with their lives. Few of them stay in touch, so I don't think it'll be a huge deal.

My lone liferope has been my parents, who love me and support me with all of their hearts. And this is the absolute worst thing I could ever do to them, and I feel horribly guilty about it. I will be ruining the rest of their lives. This is a terrible, selfish thing that I am going to do. 

But I've considered for a very long time, many years, and I decided that I've only been living because I don't want my parents to be sad about me being dead. And I'm not very sure that's a real life, living for somebody else's sake. 

So I'm not quite sure how to go about it, since I want it to be quick and thorough and not leave any mess for anybody (minus the whole dead body thing). I'm not asking for advice. I guess I don't really know what I'm asking. I thought maybe some of you would have thoughts on this.

10956,"i'm not sure what's happening to meHello

I'm not sure if this is the right place to make such a post. I don't think i'm at risk for suicide. I also didn't think that I was paranoid. I also thought that my head was clear, and I was thinking straight. Recently it feels like I have not been in control of myself. So, I guess i'm making this post to because I really don't know what to do.

I was never much of a cutter. In high school, I sliced my left forearm three times over the course of one fairly stressful day. For five years after that, I didn't intentionally cut myself at all. I tried it once, and never really understood why people do it - there was no stress relief, no emotional control, it just hurt. As I am writing this post, I have run out of room to cut my left arm, and am currently learning to handle a razor with my left hand so I can start working on my right arm. I have absolutely no idea what triggered this. I have no idea why I keep doing it. I don't think i'm trying to kill myself, but every day I wake up with ten more cuts.

I've never had trouble being alone. I've probably spent the majority of my life more alone than not. Lockdown hasn't really had an effect on me. I say these things with some confidence, but i'm not sure if they are true. I've managed to convince myself that all my friends are lying to me. Once or twice a week I am overcome with extreme paranoia. Last night I was absolutely sure that there was someone hiding in my house. Every car I see in my rearview mirror is following me. Every time I re-enter a room everything has been rearranged. Shadows are starting to look like people. My head feels clear, but at the same time my thoughts are messy. I'm not sure what's happening to me.

I don't have a family history of mental illness. My mom and sister are on antidepressants, but nobody else in my family or extended family takes any mood altering drugs. It's been years since i've abused a drug. Six months ago it really felt like I was getting a grip. 

Sorry for the rant. I've never told anyone any of this. I'm just not sure what to do.",suicide,"i m not sure what s happening to mehello i m not sure if this is the right place to make such a post i don t think i m at risk for suicide i also didn t think that i was paranoid i also thought that my head was clear, and i was thinking straight recently it feels like i have not been in control of myself so, i guess i m making this post to because i really don t know what to do  i was never much of a cutter in high school, i sliced my left forearm three times over the course of one fairly stressful day for five years after that, i didn t intentionally cut myself at all i tried it once, and never really understood why people do it  there was no stress relief, no emotional control, it just hurt as i am writing this post, i have run out of room to cut my left arm, and am currently learning to handle a razor with my left hand so i can start working on my right arm i have absolutely no idea what triggered this i have no idea why i keep doing it i don t think i m trying to kill myself, but every day i wake up with ten more cuts  i ve never had trouble being alone i ve probably spent the majority of my life more alone than not lockdown hasn t really had an effect on me i say these things with some confidence, but i m not sure if they are true i ve managed to convince myself that all my friends are lying to me once or twice a week i am overcome with extreme paranoia last night i was absolutely sure that there was someone hiding in my house every car i see in my rearview mirror is following me every time i re enter a room everything has been rearranged shadows are starting to look like people my head feels clear, but at the same time my thoughts are messy i m not sure what s happening to me  i don t have a family history of mental illness my mom and sister are on antidepressants, but nobody else in my family or extended family takes any mood altering drugs it s been years since i ve abused a drug six months ago it really felt like i was getting a grip  sorry for the rant i ve never told anyone any of this i m just not sure what to do ",430
12139,"Suicidal person curious about experience of people who have been medicatedSo I have numerous reasons. In a lot of ways, on paper, my life isn't that bad, nevertheless I would just rather not.  My life didn't get bearable until I made the plan to quit my job, spend all my money traveling then come back and etc.  

There are things that make me sad, but I don't know if I would say its depression that has had me leaning in this direction for almost the last two years.  It seems very rational to me, based on several specific circumstances.  I can't account for the mysteries of what might lay beyond or the fact that it would devastate my family, notwithstanding I am very calmly approaching the end. 

I never considered medications, for one its not sadness and so in my eyes not depression but reasons of futility.  It seems like the western conception of depression pathologizes the individual looks at it through the only prism a biologist for instance is capable of understanding a person losing drive in life which is chemical ratios, which you know maybe could just be how a very ordinary reaction to overwhelming circumstances appears in the brain.  It doesn't seem like western medicine can make the leap to suspect that maybe there is something wrong with our society, how we live, the disparity between what we are told will make us happy and reality, that maybe it is myriad external forces and not something that can just be washed over by manipulating chemicals in the brain.  I don't know, I studied culture and why we make the choices we do, I see how we see from the side and so to me everything has a more holistic explanation.

To the topic, what was the transition like for those of you who took medication?  Did it remove sadness by just not making you feel anything?  How did it make you able to bear the reasons you felt like life wasn't worth living?  Are you now forever dependent on the medication?  I remember reading about David Foster Wallace and how the Oscillations of his wellness to unwellness associated with some antidepressant may have had a role in his ultimately killing himself.

To possibly save you time, I'm not necessarily contemplating saving myself through medication.  I'm kind of winding my way back and forth across the edges of whats permissible in some of these subreddits to try and find my way to something, I'm not exactly sure what.

12282,"Living for my pets / my illness makes me want to give upI have a few chronic disabilities / illnesses, and I've had a myriad of other problems (including multiple tumours), but the one that restricts me the most is interstitial cystitis. It causes chronic pain, it's forced me to quite my job, give up my education, resulted in broken friendships because I have to cancel plans all the time, it's damaged my relationship because intimacy hurts and makes the symptoms worse. I barely leave the house, I'm in constant pain, and I'm always uncomfortable and embarrassed. I'm only 26 but it feels as though my life is over. I've tried almost every treatment possible, including incredibly invasive ones, and none of them seem to work. In fact, I've only been getting worse.  I've struggled with depression and anxiety almost all my life, but now it's become unbearable. Between the IC and the other health conditions I have, I don't even think I have a life any more, it's just an endless, lonely cycle of pain and surgeries that leave scars that hurt in the cold, and medications that make me sick and causes my hair fall out, and my bones to ache.

I have a 3 year old cat and a one year old dog. Sometimes, they're the only thing that keep me going. I love them so much, and they were both taken from pretty unpleasant situations, and are very nervous around strangers / unsettled by change. They are both deeply bonded to me (to the point where they follow me everywhere), and I know if anything happened to me, they'd be so scared and confused. 

It sounds ridiculous and utterly pathetic, but sometimes they're the only thing keeping me going.

At least real life ones. I only have the confidence to talk to girls who make the first move to talk to me online. Only girls who live very far away from me, as well. I've had many online relationships. None of them ever developed into sexual relationships or anything like that. I've never even seen a woman's chest other than in a porn video. I've never even held a woman's hand before. Besides from my terrible luck with woman, I have no guy friends either. Not a single one.

3906,"I’m a toxic personI am diagnosed with BPD and am currently in therapy that feels/felt like I was getting somewhere for the first time in...forever. My closest friend is my ex and he’s very supportive in my recovery even though towards the end of our relationship I hurt him deeply and often, something I’m still remorseful about to this day.

Among those things were issues I caused within his friendship group due to me “splitting” and seeing those people as against me. I know I was wrong even though those feelings felt rational at the time but he worries I’ll never get along with them and I don’t see the point in trying to when they already dislike me. We had a huge argument about it last night because I said I didn’t regret acting on my feelings...only the fallout which isn’t true because I regret both but it’s hard for me to admit i’m wrong when I feel attacked.. 

The reason this matters is because we both had planned to be with each other again in the future but I feel like now I’ve ruined everything. 

He told me last night I haven’t changed which hurt because I feel like i’ve been doing so much better and communicating better and not acting on impulse..I just made a mistake last night.

I hate hurting the people I love and I know they will be better off without me because I’m toxic and manipulative and I don’t think I’ll ever recover. Suicide is almost an act of kindness when it comes to me...it’s like putting an animal down so it can’t hurt anyone else.

I have pills but not enough to be fatal. In the past what stopped me was not wanting to traumatise someone by jumping in front of a train or jumping from a building and I’m sorry if I do but I need the guarantee that I will not wake up. My mother lives in a high rise with fire escapes, I’m going to her house tomorrow for a family event and I’ll be staying the night and in the early hours of the morning I’ll take the codeine I have and jump. Hopefully I’ll be so high I won’t feel the fear or the pain as my body hits the ground.

She'd throw plates at me, threaten me with a knife, even pointed a gun at me once. At one point she started assaulted me. She'd shove me into walls and to the ground, or slap me hard.

Often she wouldn't use my name, Just call me ""brat"". Every day she'd tell me nobody cares about me, My feelings are worthless, I'm stupid, I'm a fuck up, She tell me she wishes she'd aborted me. I cannot go a day without being harassed and insulted.

Eventually she graduated from shoving to punching me so hard she cuts my face and my nose bleeds, Strangling me, Throwing me on the ground and kicking me in the stomach repeatedly.

She constantly threatens my life. We have a cemetery across the street from us, she tells me she could strangle me in my sleep and bury the body in the cemetery.

So we did, but that left the upstairs vacant. So my parents wanted to rent it to someone. They were gonna pick this marine that was staying here for a bit, but gave it to a family near us who’s house burned down. So they come in, we’re next door, snazzy. So since I’m next door and now in high school all honors classes, I come over a lot less, I’ve been trying as hard as possible to visit and I can always only squeeze in an hour, I wish I had more time, but mostly I don’t. And whenever I come the kid from upstairs is with my grandpa watching football. I was never a sporty kid but I did play a lot cuz of my parents. Anyway, he’ll be talking with him and they’ll have coffee and they’ll be having a grand old time. Now whenever I knock on the door I say hi and my grandpa basically says “hey” in a mildly enthusiastic tone. My grandpa is around 60 ish. Well sit and talk, but mostly small talk. He’ll be coloring on his phone with the tv on, and well just sit there. He has his share of jokes, some funny others kinda hurtful. The two I’m talking about is him joking with my grandma saying I’m his and not my grandmas. The other is “you don’t love me anymore,” followed by “you used to love me.” And man, that frickin hits HARD every time. And just in general I feel like he has more fun with the kid upstairs and I feel like I’m being replaced.",non-suicide,"so i feel like my grandpa is replacing me with my parents tenants son tl dr  me and family moved nextdoor, now family upstairs has a boy my age and i can tell my grandpa enjoys him more than me  not tldr  so, for most of my life, ive lived in a two family house, which is split with two floors each floor 3 bed 1 bath so me, my mom, my dad, my sister, and my two dogs got the upstairs, and my dads parents got the downstairs from 5th grade to most of 8th grade corona messed it up my grandpa took me to school almost every day, 8th grade it became every other day when i started taking the bus we love each other to death, i carry his middle name and hey, were hispanic, so were pretty darn close so the people we knew next door moved and wanted us to take the house so we did, but that left the upstairs vacant so my parents wanted to rent it to someone they were gonna pick this marine that was staying here for a bit, but gave it to a family near us whos house burned down so they come in, were next door, snazzy so since im next door and now in high school all honors classes, i come over a lot less, ive been trying as hard as possible to visit and i can always only squeeze in an hour, i wish i had more time, but mostly i dont and whenever i come the kid from upstairs is with my grandpa watching football i was never a sporty kid but i did play a lot cuz of my parents anyway, hell be talking with him and theyll have coffee and theyll be having a grand old time now whenever i knock on the door i say hi and my grandpa basically says hey in a mildly enthusiastic tone my grandpa is around 60 ish well sit and talk, but mostly small talk hell be coloring on his phone with the tv on, and well just sit there he has his share of jokes, some funny others kinda hurtful the two im talking about is him joking with my grandma saying im his and not my grandmas the other is you dont love me anymore, followed by you used to love me  and man, that frickin hits hard every time and just in general i feel like he has more fun with the kid upstairs and i feel like im being replaced ",428

That’s kinda been the biggest problem because I’ve never known if so things wrong with me cause whenever I say do or think somthing weird I just think in the back of my head that I’m making it up for attention so for a long time I kept all these feelings to myself. I’ve always tried to be a mild mannered person and have always done my best to be known as a kind person but I spend conservatively 30% of my day thinking about dieing, and that is specifically just imagining ways to die. It’s usually not just suicide though so I would say that I’m probably not suicidal though I think about it a lot and do think of it as an escape option if I ever royally fuck up, I’d say I more have a death wish. This whole situation started coming to ahead after I moved out because I started taking more drugs then and noticed that it does lead to me getting foggy and paranoid of things that don’t make sense. But more recently I’ve been doing lots of psychedelics and the other night I did a few mushrooms and just started saying the things I only thought to myself and my friends looked at me like I was the joker but it only made me feel good, to get it off my chest and to have someone confirm that there was something wrong with me it’s weird but being told I’m mentally disturbed made me feel sane for the first time cause I couldn’t doubt it and I think that doubt had made me a much more paranoid and second guessing pourpose. I know these aren’t useful but I’ve been trying those online tests and psychosis seems to be a consistent high risk, I’m honestly not sure what to do with this though, part of me kinda wants to be okay with it and to take it into account so that I can atleast live my life know what’s wrong up there.

2332,"It's my 22nd birthday and that's 22 too much for me**+++ For the record, I'm not following any of the shit ideas my head has. At least don't intend to. +++**

All my life I've been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata. I am alone, I have no family as they are totally shitty. My ""friends"" also abandoned me, I'm just not good enough or too annoying.

One of the first things I did around midnight (almost 1am now) is posting a depressing meme to reddit which I prepared an hour before. Whilst crying. I am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here. I feel dead inside and at the same time like I'm about to explode.

My head is constantly having thoughts like ""What could we do today? What about overdosing on painkillers or so?"" or before when I was in a subway thinking that I should better be below it and that's really annoying. Also I know that it's not the best way anyway and I wouldn't want to involve others in such a thing. That'd be awful. It is my 22nd birthday and I feel like I should ask for an apology that I wasn't aborted. Everyone resents me in the end and there's nothing I can do about it.

My whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom I also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if I committed suicide. I just wanna vanish. I can't because I lost someone to suicide and this feeling - I just can't make the ones I love feel like that. As much as I want to cease to exist.

I. Hate. Everything.

I don't know what to do and I don't know why I am even writing this when I don't actually intend to do anything? Whatever. In a month I am 2 years selfharm-free (used to cut myself heavily) and even that doesn't cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope. Eating disorder flaring up so I get at least a fake sense of control. Maybe I die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15%. But maybe another of my diseases gets me first.

I have chronic pain and it's awful. I just want to stop that. I want it to end. It hurts. My body as well as my mind. I can't handle it.",suicide,"it s my 22nd birthday and that s 22 too much for me   for the record, i m not following any of the shit ideas my head has at least don t intend to     all my life i ve been abandoned, neglected and traumatized, got around 50 traumata i am alone, i have no family as they are totally shitty my friends also abandoned me, i m just not good enough or too annoying  one of the first things i did around midnight almost 1am now is posting a depressing meme to reddit which i prepared an hour before whilst crying i am sitting alone in my room and nobody is here i feel dead inside and at the same time like i m about to explode  my head is constantly having thoughts like what could we do today? what about overdosing on painkillers or so? or before when i was in a subway thinking that i should better be below it and that s really annoying also i know that it s not the best way anyway and i wouldn t want to involve others in such a thing that d be awful it is my 22nd birthday and i feel like i should ask for an apology that i wasn t aborted everyone resents me in the end and there s nothing i can do about it  my whole family is hateful and especially towards me, my mother which whom i also cut contact by now confirmed that my father would likely be glad if i committed suicide i just wanna vanish i can t because i lost someone to suicide and this feeling  i just can t make the ones i love feel like that as much as i want to cease to exist  i hate everything  i don t know what to do and i don t know why i am even writing this when i don t actually intend to do anything? whatever in a month i am 2 years selfharm free used to cut myself heavily and even that doesn t cause any emotions but missing having a way to cope eating disorder flaring up so i get at least a fake sense of control maybe i die from this, then nobody loses me to suicide, chance is 15  but maybe another of my diseases gets me first  i have chronic pain and it s awful i just want to stop that i want it to end it hurts my body as well as my mind i can t handle it ",427
5443,"The very first people that want you to stay alive, are the last to help.I posted yesterday about euthanasia in unpopular opinion, and I only got down votes, and posts ""it will get better"", ""you're too young"". That's what I mean, exactly this. Why does it bother people that someone wants to humanely opt out, be gone, be done?

The more I think about all this, the more it seems to be the best thing to do.

We will die anyway, but for someone who's been dead already, what difference does it make? If you went through some sort of trauma, it will always be with you, it will always haunt you.

There are so many variables in life, they all matter. Don't even try telling me otherwise, because that will be straight up lie. You'll never live the life to the fullest, you'll never experience what it has to offer.

Mental rape lives a mark, it's like a scar. 

I would rather die by euthanasia, or assisted suicide, but I could never afford it, it's quite ridiculous, that people who ""think"" that are helping others, are at the same time exploiting them, or maybe it's just a poor person perspective. Maybe those XX thousands required, aren't that much in rich countries, and are easy to get.

I've been to a forest yesterday, took me 3 hours to go back and forth, the only place where I feel free, and welcome, where I feel somehow stable. I guess that's the reason why so many people decide to end it all there, makes sense. We live alone, we die alone.

Tomorrow I'm going there again, and I hope it's the last thing I will ever do, I'll endure seconds of pain, that will in fact save me years of even more pain in a long run. That's the only compromise I see, the only way, as what has been done, can't be undone, and there are no other ways of changing my situation, unless I won some lottery ticket, so I could start fresh live, in Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, be a truck driver, or whatever. But one thing is certain, I'll never stop thinking about it, so who knows how long would I live my new life.

i wasn't mad at the guy. i was mad that i had paid for more than £15 worth of mcdonalds and i didn't get a refund or my food. i called up the mcdonalds and tried to explain what had happened, but they didn't care. they said it's not their responsibility once the food leaves the store. but i was *starving*. i can go on for days without eating, only to binge for two days and feel like pure shit after.

because they couldn't do anything, and i had been waiting for more than an hour for the food i had a go at the guy on the phone. i was crying because of the wasted money and food. i hung up after shouting 'fuck you' down the phone.

i have worked in retail before. i have worked in a chip shop, kfc and a subway for a few years, only quit my job for university. but if someone had spoken to me like that i would have killed myself. and i have tried to twice. i was thinking of the guy i was yelling at, whether he has suicidal thoughts, and if this one small mistake was the tipping point for him. and i cant help feeling guilty for what i have said to the worker.

For some reason I just can't feel happy. No matter what happens, be it good or bad, I just don't feel anything anymore. I keep pushing people away that are trying to help. Everything that used to give me joy, or at the very least distract me, no longer does so. Activities that I used to enjoy like exercising or playing video games now just annoy me and make me feel worse when I do them. It's gotten to the point where I simply don't do anything after work except lie and bed and await the next terrible day.  
Things have been like this for what seems my entire life. I've hurt myself in the past. I've thought about suicide several times each and every single day. The thought never escapes me. Every slightest screw-up I make or misunderstanding I cause throws me over the edge. The social anxiety makes it impossible for me to speak to other people, let alone open up to them about my feelings. Being around other people, even people I view as friendly, just makes me so nervous and panicky. I've tried calling the hotline several times but when the other end picks up I just freeze up and hang up out of panic. I don't even really know what to say even if I wanted to open up. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, or why I'm like this or feel the way I do.   
I just want to stop feeling like this. I don't know if typing this all out will help or do anything for me. I don't know what I want or what I need. Everything is just so confusing and nothing makes sense anymore.

15669,"How can I do it?I didn’t realize until three years ago that I’ve been depressed my entire life. I grew up with a lot of abuse from my parents while growing up in the Netherlands. Doctors and schools didn’t do anything while I had numerous visits of bruises and broken bones. I was also always a misfit and tried my best to fit in. Despite all of it I’ve dealt with some bullying in my teens that I still carry a grudge from it until today. I obsessively despise these people that have hurt me and scarred me so much. Now fast forward in my thirties I just can’t seem to find one thing that brings me real joy but my dogs. I have no joy in my work despite making ok money. It’s ironic knowing I’ve been working since 13 and have even taken on a factory job at a chicken manufacture. I should be grateful how far I’ve come but I still despise every little thing about me, and I’m just so angry and sad about every little thing. I have a ten year relationship with my boyfriend whom I’ve financially supported 9 out of ten years so he can achieve his dreams. Societal and cultural pressure of getting married, having kids, and buying a home have just taken the best of me that I started resenting him. I’ve vocalized the past five years what I want in our relationship and he basically says I’m impatient and I have a nasty personality for wanting to get married. Last weekend was my best friends wedding and I was just so heartbroken to explain to numerous people that we have not made any single progress to building a family together. My life and everything about it makes me feel so invaluable. I hate myself and I can’t deal with the pressure of sadness on my chest anymore. I just want to go but don’t know how. I just want to sleep and never wake up. No one is going to care. Heck I’ve been crying for months after every work shift for hours until I fall asleep and my significant other doesn’t bother to ask or question if I’m ok. It’s funny cause I put my boyfriend as a beneficiary of my assets if I were to pass away. I should make some changes before leaving. If I could just get up and leave.

I seriously don’t even know what I’m doing anymore I’ve been scraping through university I actually have more fails then passes at this point and I’m in my second year. Pretty sure I’ve failed every subject this semester and I didn’t need to. But I can’t help myself I’m self-sabotaging I destroy my life every single fucking time I get it back on track…. Every time.  

Finally got a great bunch of friends is that what you called them? I think more of them are acquaintances. The one friend I thought would have my back when shit got rough didn’t well no surprise there so much for equality. If she has a problem I was always there for her to talk to but when I’m spiralling into a dark place is she ever there for me? No of course not why would she be I’m obviously not worth the time so fuck her and her friendship. I’m your close friend when I need support but if you need it I’m not even going to try and talk to you. Seriously fuck friendships I’m so done. 

So I’ll probably fail this course no surprise I don’t really have the personal aptitude for university or this career path but then what sure failing university isn’t the end of the world but I think it should be at least for me. The thought of existence without purpose drives me crazy if I fail what am I supposed to do? Go find some shitty as job so I can pay bills to live a mundane existence alone? Why fucking bother I’d rather just go kill myself and if it comes that point I think I might actually have the balls to pull it off. I’ve always been a coward because there’s always some glimmer of hope but fuck it I don’t care anymore everything I do is pointless. 

I just spent two weeks ignoring the world and now I’ve re-emerged I know every I knew thinks of me differently. They don’t know what it’s like judgemental ass-holes getting everything in life handed to them on a silver platter.

Even then, I cannot derive any comfort from that notion. For far too long I have lead myself to believe that I'd achieve something. That I will eventually take hold of my future, and aspire to do something meaningful. Can I say I've given it my all? No. Well, at the very least, have I felt satisfied in the few instances I've become invested in a certain task or something similar? No, whenever I've attempted something like maintaining a job, or increasing my GPA, I've always failed on some level. I've become so comfortable with keeping to myself that I struggle with relationships at the most basic level. I go into passive mode and just fall out of touch with those around me. Any job that requires effective communication like facing customers and putting on a smile, I flounder. I come off as some kind of socially inept weirdo on the fringe of being considered mentally handicapped. I've been openly mocked by past fellow employees, and I don't fault them for it. Some of the things I did and said would've caused me to possibly confer similar things if I were not the one perpetrating the bizarre behavior. I was so miserable when I worked at these places. A few times I wrote suicide notes while I was on break, although I never truly believed I'd follow through on anything. 
If I could succeed academically I'd probably be able to put this aside, as there might be hope I could get a job that would suit my personality. Of course, I wouldn't be relating this if I were, so what hope is there? I'm currently taking my third semester of classes at my local comm. college and I have something like a 2.6 GPA. I'm most likely going to have to drop the math class I'm taking and possibly another one if I don't complete an essay that needs to be turned in later today...

6703,"Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im 15 and from behind one could realisticly assume a late 20s early 30s man was standing in front of them. This turns out to be really confusing for some people...

1.My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook.

The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time (this was pre corona).

As my dad and I were looking around, I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost. Initially I just assumed a middle age man (from his voice) was asking an employee, even if his question didnt exactly make sense (hard disk or ssd presumably), so I ignored him. 

The guy repeated his question a few times but again, I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him.

Now, I was wearing a fluorescent shirt. Mistake. The employees also wore flourescent. 

Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder.

“How much does a terabyte cost?”

“Oh I dont work here”I say, revealing my baby face.

The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude.

We still laugh at this instance today, even though its been a few months. Never saw the guy again.

TLDR: someone thought I was a store employee, I was not

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together.

For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present, or should I say, all of them.

The dinner starts (it was all you can eat) and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents (its kind of their thing, they drink a lot). Of course, they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students. Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder (quite obviously talking to me):

“would you like some wine?”

I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing. They thought I was my dad (in this story i was 13 and roughly the same size as my dad). My stature had struck again. Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad.

9299,"I don't want to die but I don't want to live eitherI'm coming to this subreddit rather abruptdly

Hell, i dunno if this post will even stay up long enough for anyone to see

But, I've been drinking and ik if I don't post now I'll never post sober.

About a year ago from this time period I nearly committed suicide via prescription pills.

Whether it was because of my own mental instability or my unit looking down upon me (U.S. Army) I dunno.

They left on a deployment back in October-ish and left me behind.

A brokedick PFC with no deployments, no awards, no merit but completing OSUT on the verge of suicide, meanwhile my unit has NCO's who did multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan during the peak of the surge without any major mental malfunctions like me.

Since then I've been doing my best to get back on track. I stopped abusing pills, I stopped drinking, I was taking the gym seriously again (before the pandemic shut everything down), etc.

But my Squad Leaader puts out a text saying the unit will be back in roughly 2 weeks.

And what do I do as soon as I read the text? I fucking plow through half a bottle of Jack because I can't mentally cope with the idea of me still being around with them being back.

EBH tells me I got PTSD from my time with them. They're probably nolt wtrong iof I'm drinking myself stupid just from a text talking about them coming back but fuck. As an Infantryman that just sounds like Little Heart Syndrome more than anyhting. (I talked about this on /r/Veterans)

fuck

I don't want to die. Fighting - boxing/kickboxing/MMA is my life and was the only thing that stopped me from going through with suicide when my family, God, etc. wasn't enough. I've been working my ass off running, eating right, etc. to make a comeback.

But at the same time I don't want to be alive when they come back either.

I dunno. I'll probably regret hitting the ""Post"" button by the time tommorow morning when I'm sober, but I needed to get all this off my chest, and ik I can't tell anyone in my unit about this w/o them trying to report me to a suicide ward.

9364,"I'm having suicidal thoughts, but don't want to diei’ve been some having suicidal thoughts in the last few weeks. i don’t want to kill myself, and i don’t necessarily want to die. i'm having feelings of worthlessness, feeling alone (my best friend just moved to the other side of the world), and that I matter to no one. i just turned 30 in May, and i feel so unaccomplished.

Last October, I spent a weekend in the ER when I went in for suicidal thoughts. It was the scariest thing I had ever done, but I was officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety, began taking medication, and seeing a therapist.

Things were on the up &amp; up until recently. I had a job that was supposed to be for 3 months (working in TV), but it got cut short and the show went on hiatus. that was the end of april. i haven't been able to find another job. my mother supports me financially and i feel guilty for it. i live in LA and she's on the east coast. she struggles enough to make her own ends meet, and then she has to worry about me. she's beyond retirement age and still working because of me.

sleeping has been horrible for me lately. i go to bed around 4-5am, and wake up between 2-5pm. it makes the day go by faster when i have NOTHING to do.

the only reasons i won't kill myself is because i don't think i'm capable of physically harming myself, i don't want to do that to my mom, i don't want to leave my cats alone, and (the stupidest reason imo) i don't want to miss the newest season of big brother.

i've thought about going back to the ER, but that wasn't the best experience, being on suicide watch, having no privacy, and having guards staring at me 24/7.

i have an appointment with my therapist this weekend, but I don't want to tell her what I've been feeling. 

i'm also debating on whether or not to tell my mother. i didn't tell her about going to the ER in October, she found out from a friend and flew out to be with me.

9473,"I have never wanted to continue. 22 f, my tl;dr story.So it all started with when I was little. My dad had been abusing me since I was 7 years old. Verbally, physically, emotional and even sexually. I went through deep depression from 12years onwards, struggling with variations of self harm; cutting, burning, I even developed trichotillomania, anxiety disorder and alot of trust issues.
Fast forward with all this crap to 17 years old, where I met a guy off the internet and ran away to be with him. Fast forward another two months and he began physically abusing me. I let it slide too many times to count. After a while, I ran away to another guy I met off the internet. He was nice, but he was too far into the churchy side of things and I was told I had demons in me, so I ran back to the abusive guy. Fast forward with the same abuse and we buy a house together in 2010. Things are still bad, and I kept making stupid mistakes. I tried to reach out to my brothers friend, and he ended up text messaging me one day after my boyfriend hit me, saying he'd 'kill him', boyfriend found out and kicked me out of the house. I had nowhere to go but back to my dads, where that abuse started back up. I ended up getting with a guy from my work 3 months later, and he was lovely. Old boyfriend found out, said sorry and that he'd change, so I was stupid enough to go back.
Fast forward one and a half years, and I'm sitting on his parents couch, still in the abusive relationship, with no friends (because he made me get rid of them), still with same depression, still trying to self harm and stuck in a job I don't want but I have to stay at because he quit his job. My family won't speak to me, and haven't since 2009, and I have no one to turn to at all. I'm stuck in this terrible situation, with no way around it and no one to talk to.

This is my last option. I hate my life, I've hated it since I was a little kid. I have no future, I have no hopes, dreams or goals. I have emotional and physical issues. I have no one. And I am no one.

My boyfriend and I were having sexy time in my room here and we were watching standup on my phone at the same time .. He did something awesome and I told him to keep going and he asked if I was sure and I said please and .. He didn't do it again . I was facing my phone watching the show while he was ya know .. Anyways he just stops and says I'm not paying any attention to him . 

I told him I was and that I'm surprised he didn't take the chance to do that awesome thing .. Anyways . He got butthurt cause I had attitude . Mini fight whatever.

Go back to cuddling and watching the show when he starts snoring! 
I try n wake him cause I wanted to go to the frog room so my gma doesn't think we fooled around .. He doesn't want to and I get upset about the fact he was the one who wanted to sleep together in the first place and was upset when I said earlier we should maybe just sleep separately like my gma suggested .

Anyways I stopped the floor like the spoiled rat I am and he considered that kicking him since he was laying right next to my stomping then he started being really mean and saying I kicked him and that I'm mean and blah blah..

So I kick him. He punches my leg. I leave so I doesn't turn into a worse fight.. He gets up shuts the door behind me and locks it . 


He knows I can't handle this . I can't be alone like this unprompted and while he's mad . I have no one to talk Tocqueville he's ignoring me and now probably back to sleep. 

I know I shouldn't have done what I did but I already cut myself (barely . I stopped myself since I'm getting inspected Monday..) I'm depressed and I don't like being alone . Now I just keep hearing in my head how horrible of a person I am and how I should just kill myself here .

Other than this course, I’ve never really done a true test before. My school finds different ways to see if we learnt what was taught in class. But not having done tests before, this class was such a hard introduction to a college level course. 
Tomorrow is my final that’s worth 30% of my total grade. I have to take it at 9:00, so I can’t study any more at this point. If I get anything less than 75%, I will get an F in the class. I’ve tried studying for the test but none of it is working and I’m 100% sure that I will fail. I’ve never taken a final and I’m not getting any help on studying tips or anything from anyone around me. They assume it will be fine. They’re wrong, I know it won’t be fine.
If I fail this class, my GPA will plummet and I don’t have many other graded classes I’ve done, so this one will affect my entire GPA. I’m not going to be able to get into college. And if I can’t get into college, what the hell am I going to do.

I’m the only one in my family who isn’t some super smart A+ student who is top of their class and who already has scholarships for college. I’m a failure. I’m shit. I should just die if I’m going to ruin my life like this. If my life is going to go to shit, so I might as well take control of the situation and kill myself... It’s already been really hard this past year for me. In January I started getting really bad periods of suicidal ideation. It happens every week. It already take so much strength to prevent I’m ok. It’ll be easier to kill myself at this point...

But I don’t actually know if I can do it. I’m still teetering on the edge of cutting my wrists tomorrow while my parents are out, or taking the test and ruining my life and disappointing everyone.

1768,"My sister keeps trying to kill her self and I don’t know what to do.My sister recently had a face surgery that caused her to feel such anguish that she wants to end her life. The surgery was to correct an overbite, however she feels her jaw now looks like a man. She’s also having an identity crisis because she just doesn’t look like her. She can’t stand to look at herself and She covered up every mirror in the house. She has guilt that she spent 19000 CAD on something she hates. She regrets the surgery so much. A reversal surgery is an option, however the soft tissues may never go back, she risks losing feeling in her face and it’s not guaranteed to look like “her” again. It will also cost another 9,000 CAD.  

My sister hasn’t been well most of her life, she’s being trying to commit suicide since she was 12 years old. Before this surgery, she was upset with her boyfriend and before that her job and before that school, etc. She’s 30 now. But this go around it’s become so hopeless. She just doesn’t see a way out of her despair. 

She has attempted suicide several times over her face:
1. Tried to jump off a bridge
2. Tried to drown herself
3. Tried to cut herself
4. Ordered helium online to gas herself
5. Bought a hose to attach to her exhaust and feed in through her car window. 
6. Swallowed 100 pills. All of her medications. This one happened today. 

Every time it’s been a miracle she hasn’t died. Every time we bring her to the hospital she is let out within 24 hours. The longest she stayed was a week. It’s really tearing our family apart as none of us know how to handle any of this. I’m so afraid she’s going to die. I live every day in complete fear that any phone call I get is the one where they tell me she’s gone. I’m doing everything I think I can to make her want to live. I’m struggling with the weight of it. I’m so lost. How can I make the doctors keep her in there for longer than a day? I feel so guilty over this. If I’m doing enough. If I’m doing the right things. The only times I’m not panicking is when she’s in the hospital because I know she’s safe.

8981,"I've found a new life objective.Death. For the longest time, since I was 11 years old, I wished for the sweet release of death. Never knew why I wanted to end my life, but I figured two weeks ago that I've never had a ""life"".  
New friends stopped coming by when I turned 10. Different schools, different personalities, never synching again. I started to grow up, and suddenly there were parties, gatherings, trending topics...   
None of which I had permission to enjoy, either from my parents or from myself. More time pass by and suddenly I find myself at the end of my high school life, graduation was coming closer and it was time to pick a major. 

But who am I? I've not lived. The only world I know is the fantasies I created when alone in my room. The only voices I recognize are the ones I made when talking within my head. The only people I've met are ideas I made up when I saw someone else's face. 

I was in a protective bubble. Never experienced anything, so I had to do it myself. Never met anyone, so I had to make them up. It is like I've been born 3 years ago when I turned 18 and my parents decided I did not need protection anymore. ""Go on, live your life and do whatever you want!"" they said. 

I do not know what I want. I do not know where I want to go. I do not see a future or a past. I do not have the concept of ""dreams"" and ""goals"". I've just been born. Who am I? 

Somehow, this man-baby who is writing this found himself a girlfriend. The fantastical worlds I've made brought her attention to me. I like her. I love her. But who she likes is nothing but a pretender who doesn't know what is to live. And it's starting to show. 

I've made up my mind. I will find a job and save as much money as I possibly can.  Enough that SHE will live her dreams. Although heartbreaking for her, it's what I want. Now I have a wish. Now I have a goal. And when I finally cross the line, it will finally be a decision I won't regret making.

10904,"Hey there! Thinking about killing myself.So I've been depressed for a long time, first time I felt like this I was 14 years old, I'm 21 now. It kinda' comes and goes.

I'm on my final year of university and although I got good grades I don't think I can finish this year, which I would be terribly sad if I didn't, and it's what's likely to happen. Studying is one of the few things I enjoy doing, but when I'm depressed I can't even read a paragraph before thinking about killing myself.

I've been trying to fake it till' you make it approach since my first year. I'm popular around campus, throw a lot of parties, I'm not bad looking and I pretend not to be shy so socially I'm really good at pretending to be a extovert, outgoing guy. Though my friends have been suspecting that my heavy drinking and drug use is a excuse to hide something else, an assumption which they are more likely correct.

I like people, I feel an empathy that is abnormal, which is a recurring issue in making me depressed. If I see someone sad or miserable looking I instantly feel how I think that person is feeling, hollow. I could be the richest, most sucessful, best looking person in the world, I would still be depressed, there's nothing that can change this.

I just don't like life, and I fail to see any way that it would be better.

Although I might feel empathy I can't actually like anyone, I can't love anyone that I've found in my live. I hate being around my friends and family and I hate to pretend I enjoy it. They are good people, but it's annoying to be around people that don't understand, not depression, but how meaningless is anything they say or do. Nothing makes any sense.

The only thing that keeps me going is that I only get one living, it's obvious I will have a happy day in my life, actually I bet I still haven't lived my happiest day. But is it worth it? Would you live your life as a begger, just because you know that in your last day you would be a billionaire?

why does everyone else’s trauma turn them into a good person? why did my trauma just make me angry and spiteful and malicious? i feel like a rabid street dog with no home no love and nobody but the fleas on my back to keep me company. my dog even prefers other people to me. 

i hate my job i hate where i live i don’t have any money and no matter how fucking hard i try no matter how many applications i submit (over 100 now! i keep a spreadsheet) my portfolio is never good enough. my art is fucking garbage and i’m wasting my time in any artistic pursuit. 

i paid someone to review my shit professionally and i’m STILL not getting any call backs. i feel like the world’s shittiest designer/artist bc even my craft shit feels like child’s play compared to what i’ve seen other people do with the same mediums. even if i wasn’t comparing myself i have no confidence in my abilities and not having a support system doesn’t make it any easier. 

i feel like i’ve been love starved my whole life and now when someone tries to show me compassion i reject it bc it’s unfamiliar, but i’m dying for a fucking human connection. i’m dying to have someone outside of my partner to talk things thru and spend time with. 

i don’t mean cheating i just want a fucking friend!!!! i’m so sick of sex i just want someone to fucking talk to. 

earlier today i was feeling suicidal and raked my brain for someone to talk to bc i needed a connection and found.... no one. so i had to text one of the hotlines in order to have a conversation with a human and start to relax. it only worked for so long.

10483,"My best friend saw me try to hang myselfI’ve had depression for a couple months due to a break up. I know people get over it and whatever but this one was bad and my fault I got with a girl that was gonna do this to me sooner or later. If you guys want to I’ll go more into detail with it later. 

Well it was one of my good friend’s birthday and we were all supposed to go over to his house. I’ve gotten my mind off of her mostly but sometimes she pops up. And that day was the worst of them. I spent the whole day in bed listening to depressy music. I guess my best friend(who isn’t the birthday friend) came to check up on me. There’s one window that can’t be blocked with shutters so he climbed up to see what I was doing. Keep in mind that it was 9 pm so I couldn’t really see out the window. So I couldn’t see him.

When he looked it was about the time when I was crying and yelling. I then went and took a shit ton of shots of NyQuil which can fuck up your liver. I’m not sure if he saw me cutting my thigh and hitting myself. I then grabbed a rope tied a noose and hung it up in my closet. The thing is I tried to hang myself but I was too tall to fully do it(I’m 6 foot 5 inches). All I did was hurt my neck and for a while have a hard time breathing. But he saw all that play out. I locked all the doors so no one could get in so I’m guessing he waited for my dad to get home to check on me. He came over to my room. I quickly got up and opened the door making it seem like I was asleep and did nothing.

After that the guy confronted me on the phone a day later. And I told him my problems and started crying. Hopefully he didn’t hear that. He didn’t understand why I wanted to do it. Which is fair. I’m not sure why I wanted to do it. I just got the sudden urge to kill myself. I’m just tired of me being in pain all the time.

I have a loving supporting mom, dad, and brother however my household feels like it’s filled with stress, resentment, and anxiety. I was abused as a child and I am horrified of what I have become. Every-time I look in a mirror I wish I could put a bullet in my brain. I’m overweight and am currently eating myself to death because of an eating disorder that my parents don’t seem to care much about, and my brother is the only person I really have in my life anymore. But he is a normal functioning human with tons of friends and I have no one. I’ve never felt more alone and this much hatred towards myself ever before. I’m constantly tired and have no will or motivation to really do anything other than sleep. I’ve lost interest in things I used to love and just feel like a husk at this point. I don’t even try and talk to girls anymore because I know I’m so hideous to look at that there is no point in trying. I have one close friend but he barley texts me. I try to keep myself distracted from how unhappy I am by playing video games and sleeping but I don’t know how much longer I can do that for. I have an awful compulsive lying habit that I would do anything to be able to stop but I just can’t. I try and put on a facade so my family doesn’t get worried because they are all great people and they don’t deserve to have a burden like me. I’ve had 3 plans to commit suicide and actually went through with one of them, which landed me in residential rehab for two months, and I was so traumatized by that place that even the thought of going back to one makes me instantly think of suicide. The only reason I don’t want to do it is because of my family because I know how much it would impact them, because they tell me all the time that if I killed myself that they would never forgive me, never move on, and that their lives would be ruined forever.

I'm 30 now and I think tonight is the night I knew would come, and my life is more or less a waste of opportunity, I know that. 

Nothing of note has really happened to me to make this the night. There isn't anything all that special about tonight. I'm not even particularly sad anymore. Depressed, yes, but not sad.The past few months I have tried to find particular films or music to make me feel much of anything. It's just time, I think. I have made this decision before. Last year, I decided to go to Vegas and bet everything I had(not much), twice, on roulette, and I won(to my luck/chagrin) which wasn't really supposed to happen. That was a weird feeling. On the plane ride out there I felt a bit like I feel now, a bit of a sinking feeling of dread and hopelessness, only then I think I actually wanted a silver lining ending. Now though, I don't even really want that. I just, want to sleep and not have to wake up again.

I know there will be at least a few that will be devastated by what I'm planning. I know there are people who do care for and love me, and fair few who like me well enough to give the ol, ""aww, that's too bad,"" but there just isn't enough left in me to try for them and I have long ago given up on myself.

8701,"If my report card isn't straight As, I'm killing myself.I'm currently a high school senior (17f). I'm enrolled I'm basic classes required for graduation, a math course, and two extracurriculars, which are AP Art and Photography. 

I've been doing well with the other classes except for my art course. I haven't turned in my final project for the semester due to complete lack of motivation. My teacher, who obviously is annoyed with me at this point, and who tried her hardest to squeeze me into her class, will likely drop me. And I understand that.

I don't know if this is depression. I've been depressed in the past with 2 other suicide attempts. It probably is but I don't like self-diagnosing. Nothing in life excites me anymore. Art, my only hobby and the only thing that made me happy, it's gone. I cant even draw right anymore. Everyone else's art is gorgeous compared to mine, and gains recognition. So I just ditched my art altogether. 

My parents have wished they'd aborted me and I do too. They only seem to care about money and my grades. They don't believe in mental disorders or mental illness or therapy or medication. 

My GPA is so low that I cant even apply for the community college I'd like to attend before my university.. Which my GPA is far too low for, too. It's 2.5.. or lower right now, probably. 

If I do not get straight As this semester my GPA will not budge enough for my college qualifications. I know I already failed, so why bother making this post? For the attention I am starved of? I'm fucking too sensitive and pathetic and stupid for this cruel world.

I'm not fit for Earth. I'm sorry I'm not good enough and that I'm a burden. I'm so sorry... To no one else but my parents, since I have no friends. 

Why can't I be born on another planet? Maybe I'd be accepted on Mars, or Jupiter. Perhaps even Saturn. But not Earth.

Traditional jobs for me, which for me and my experience consist of nothing but ""unskilled labor"" despite it being the most grueling, specific work, are absolute torture. I don't know if it's my mental illnesses, my inability to turn my brain off, or what but I fucking can't.

8928,"I'm tired of keeping it all to myself.I'll start off by saying to please not give me any pity. I'm not seeking attention. I just have one question that I couldn't get solved on r/drugs despite making five different threads. They all were deleted too fast for someone to answer my question.  

I have severe anxiety, clinical depression, and soul-crushing agoraphobia. I haven't left the house for non-medical related activities in I don't know how long. Five years? Six? I'm a high school drop-out with no GED. I become erratic behind the wheel, so I have no drivers license. I feel as though I'm a failure and a burden to my family, despite their constant reinforcement and unconditional love. I have something called Factor V Leiden, and I only found out about it after I suffered a pulmonary embolism in 2016. I'm one of the youngest people to have one in my state. I'm now on blood thinners for the rest of my life, however long that may be. With all of this combined, I feel as though I'm putting far too much responsibility on my family than is necessary, and I feel ashamed that I can't simply be normal.  

Enough with the sob story. I've been on Xanax for my anxiety attacks for around three years. I don't have an addiction, and I don't think my tolerance is *too* high. I recently had my prescription refilled, and I've taken some of it since then. On an average day I'll take around 3mg, but there are some days where I'll go without it entirely or take within the ballpark of 8mg, but those days are very rare.  

If I was to take 85 1mg tablets of Xanax, would that be enough for me to overdose and die in my sleep? I've done some Googling, and I've seen that Xanax is a difficult drug to overdose with. Apparently some people can take upwards of 1000mg with very little toxicity. Is this just bullshit to attempt to keep people from overdosing?  

I'm far too afraid of doing something that will cause me actual pain, so this is why I choose the option of overdosing. And I'd like to die in my sleep, since it's a peaceful way to pass.

9073,"dont know where to turntitle says it all. i feel awful, closer and closer to suicide every day. i feel like if i say my feelings to someone, i can start to get better, but i dont know where to turn. hence why im posting here. 

i have no real relationships, my family doesnt care about me, and the only thing keeping me here is my job. im not even 18 and i feel like im drowning in negativity and self-hatred. 

i thought i was happy. but im not, and it’s my fault. ive secluded myself so people only use me to get substances or give them physical company because theyre SO’s are far away. no one wants me past that, though. 

i have no inspiration to do anything anymore. painting, being bubbly and nice, continuing on my recovery... even my job, which i love more than anything, gives me so much anxiety. 

i ruined tonight for my family. we were gonna have s’mores and a good time, but my younger brother made me mad, we argued, and i drove to a park nearby to calm down. my mom didnt know where i went, neither did her girlfriend, or my brother. i was gone for an hour and a half. no one called or texted to ask where i was or if i was ok. 

i didnt leave because i wanted to get those worried calls and texts, but after sitting at that park for an hour and a half i was like... why havent i gotten them?! does no one care!? and i realized that no one cares. at all. when i got home, no one even said anything to me. i have “friends” that use me, a family that doesnt care, and my whole optimistic nihilism philosophy is hard when i dont seem to be enjoyed by people im around. 

i dont have a plan to kill myself. i really dont even know if this sub is for this kinda stuff, i just searched “suicide” for a place to put my thoughts.

3943,"I just... need someone right now, pleaseContext: I went through a very traumatic, nasty divorce when I was a kid, and my dad got full custody. My bio mom was emotionally abusive and as a parent, neglectful. My dad, for the most part, is a good dad. He tries hard. I do love him and I know he cares about me but he also has a really bad temper. He doesn’t believe in therapy. I’ve had really bad anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I experience panic attacks every now and again — more when I’m under stressful circumstances. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time and now, in college, have been getting help. I’ve tried to tell my parents about my mental health struggles but they always shut me down and say I’m making an excuse.
My dad has really bad anger issues/issues processing and expressing his emotions appropriately. He gets upset and blows up and says really horrible things. When I was twelve, he told me he didn’t want a kid like me and that he was going to put me up for adoption. Anytime I mess up, he tells me I’m a selfish person, I don’t care about my family, and that I should be out on the street, fending for myself.
Last night, I forgot to set two cups of rice for dinner (I am still taking online college courses, am walking the dog, and keeping the house clean), and my dad’s response was to empty my bank account, shut off my phone, and is mandating I get up at 6:30 every morning. And then he screamed at me until I cried (because him screaming at me is very traumatic and reminds me of the really bad times during the divorce), and then screamed at me because I was crying, all the while telling me the things he always tells me. And I usually wind up feeling guilty like how I’m not a good person and I don’t deserve anything, but two years into a psychology degree has taught me that’s not true. 
I haven’t been close to an attempt in a few months, but I really don’t know if I can live like this. We are under shelter in place orders for a month.

I've never had the intense necessity to self-harm, but now I... I just feel like ripping my veins out—. 
Well, you be probably thinking why do I feel like that... Thing is I don't even know... I mean, I have such severe things going on, but they've been there for quite a long period of time, and never lead to anything close to this.

They rejected me from both my dream careers (Neuroscience and Genomics —but still accepted in other 3—) like 2 weeks ago, but i don't think that's the problem, or at least not the whole.
Those attacks I said usually are coined together with flashbacks —long history—, shortened version: I think I was raped around 5-7yro and I had amnesia (those flashbacks came to my mind since idk when, but long ago, but I instantly forgot about it like next day... Until 1 year ago when suddenly I got conscious about having a mental gap [however I still can't remember anything about what happened, I just know something happened].

So, the other thing is being trans... I just accepted it during this quarantine, and no close-relative knows. I'm quite anxious about it (back in time, I thought trans ppl exaggerated dysphoria, now I see it's fucking completely real), whatever, I don't thing that's what's affecting me this much rn neither.

Idk if I just had panick attacks the whole night or what, but my hands' sweating, I got random crying attacks, hyperventilation, my hearth goes crazy, and I can't fucking sleep (as a matter of fact, can't since like 1 week ago).

I don't think I've ever been successful in my life, and failing would probably mean my family would find out. They've made fun of my self harm before and didn't do anything when I told them I was feeling suicidal two years ago. If I failed, I'm afraid of just making them angry. I feel like I'm already such an inconvenience to the people I love, I'm so afraid of making them feel like they have to worry about me. I stress them out so much by being depressed and I don't want to make them feel like they need to stress even more.

15755,"Still don't see any other option.I [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3r6jvf/i_dont_know_what_to_do/) a couple months ago, and things haven't gotten any better.

The tl;dr of that: I'm an adult with depression and high functioning autism. I wasn't even diagnosed with the latter until the day I was dismissed from grad school. The reason why I was dismissed was because I had a complete breakdown after constant gaslighting and emotional abuse by my advisor (but officially it's because I'm stupid). The reason why I went to grad school in the first place was because I was struggling to support myself in the ""real world."" Because my social skills are shit, I couldn't talk my way into a decent job outside of my field. And inside my field (microbiology) you kind of need a graduate degree now to have a career.

So now I'm back to square one with no job, no marketable skills, and a spotty resume. I've been getting professional help for a while, but it's expensive and doesn't seem to help. I've been struggling to pay my bills with freelance work (which would be hard for a normal person to do, but I have about 0 energy). This month I had to accept financial help from my mom, which is bad for a few reasons: 1) I don't think she can actually afford to help me for very long and she's never been honest about money. 2) A big part of why I picked a school halfway across the country is because my family has major problems and the only mentally healthy option I have is to keep them at a distance. 3) I'm in my late 20s and it's fucking pathetic.

The job market is so competitive and there's such a stigma when it comes to mental illness and autism that I don't think I'll ever find a job that pays a living wage and doesn't make me miserable. Why would anyone ever hire me over a normal person with a great resume? I'm too functional for anyone to give a shit but not functional enough to have a life.

9897,"Giving up.I don't really know where to begin. 

There's so much detail in this that anyone I know could identify me, but I'm beyond caring at this point. Far beyond.

The past few years have been some of the worst of my life. I watched my dreams of medical school drift down the tubes, as my GPA steadily declined. The only job I've ever wanted... The only thing I've ever been passionate about.

I'm being sued for a car accident I was in several years ago.

My parents are likely going bankrupt, and will likely end up losing their home.

In the past year I did something truly awful in my long term relationship, and ruptured the trust completely of the only person I really love. Or will ever love for that matter. I hate myself daily for the pain I've caused them.

My father is going through severe chemical treatments for a life altering disease.

My twin brother was diagnosed with cancer today.

Our dog passed away last night.

I cry uncontrollably for no reason, at random times. Most of the time I can't identify the cause, it's just sort of a numbness, a lack of any emotion other than complete dread for anything else that could possibly go wrong. I feel like a failure. Everyone around me is ill, or being hurt by society in some way, and I'm the cause of my own anguish. I screwed up, I failed, I'm the reason I'm not good enough. I don't have my environment to blame, only my own stupidity.

I don't know why I'm writing here. I suppose because I feel like I don't really have anyone else to turn to.

I've been depressed for years on end, and I've considered suicide frequently, but the thing that has prevented my actions are the thoughts of hurting my family even more than they currently suffer. I don't want to do that to them... But maybe, I could go on a trip, I could plan meticulously to have letters sent to them, as if I was travelling the world. I could gradually fall out of contact. They might think I'm happy somewhere. They might think I'm living.

13711,"I get it, I'm a piece of taMaybe I'm just having a bad day where all my shortcomings are coming to bear all at once, but I feel like no matter what I do, I can never improve my lot in life.

It kind of started in middle school, really; I was bullied a lot, and I always fantasized about how one day I'll be better than my bullies, how I'll be able to one up them and show them who's boss.

I made it through middle and highschool, I wasn't the top of my class (in fact, my bullies unfortunately ended up higher than me), but I didn't think that'd matter, since when we were all going off to college, I heard they all were studying what was considered ""useless"" stuff, like graphic design, while I was going in for computer science.

I figured I'd finally get what I wanted; to finally be better off than them. (One of the things they made fun of me for was that I came from a poor family.)

Fast forward to graduating college, and I can't even find a job besides the one I was working to pay for my tuition, and meanwhile, I heard one of them has a six figure gig in California already lined up.

I couldn't even at least take solace in the fact that I at least had a better social life than them, all my friends hated me for breaking up with my girlfriend at the time. My bullies? Engaged to be married.

Three years later, I get demoted at my old highschool job, meaning I have to take a pay cut and lose all my benefits that I had to fight tooth and nail to get. (Which didn't stop them from periodically taking them away from me without rhyme or reason.)

Meanwhile, the rest of my bullies are making it big.

I don't even want to be more successful than them, anymore. I get it; they're a gift to the world and I'll never compare to them, my rightful place is beneath them.

Here's the thing.  I'm in my late thirties.  I own a small business and employ about 10 people.  It is very stressful.  I work constantly, and am in constant fear of making a mistake that will cost someone their job.  

I've had flings but no serious relationship for many years - work is my life.  And I'm done with it.  The smallest tasks feel like mountains.  Things I used to breeze through now fill me with dread.

And I know what the responses are.  Talk to someone. Take a break.  I can't.  Talk to someone?  Some family-practice shrink who reaches for their scrip pad as soon as they realize they don't know what they're doing?  Talk to my friends, with their own families, with their own significant issues?  No.  And a break?  Not possible.  Maybe in a year or two, when I've hired someone and groomed them a bit, but not before then.

So here I am.  the 2-3 days without work I've snatched over the last two weeks are blissful but remind me *I DONT WANT TO WORK TOMORROW* but I *have* to.  And with anything, that's always the answer, right?  No matter what you feel, how tired, how depressed, you just have to keep grinding.  Keep going.  Things will turn.  But I'm tired.  I don't want to grind anymore.  I do, but I don't, if that makes sense.

The things I know will help - 2-3 months off, heavy time spent with friends doing nothing - isn't an option.  I can't take that time off, and I can't ask my friends to just pause their lives to correct my issues.

So I dunno.  Ultimately, I doubt I'll do ""it"" - too much of a coward - but every day, it is a constant option that gets better and better sounding.  And more and more just a question of when, rather than if.

I made my first 'attempt' on my life at the start of this year, but I'm not sure if it was just a cry for help, because it wasn't particularly serious although it was well thought out and kind of crossed all the hurdles that were previously keeping me alive. So, last Sunday I overdosed on lorazepam (ativan). It wasn't a lethal dose, I checked online beforehand.  It was all I had of it though, if I had more I probably would have taken them. I just wanted the paranoid intrusive thoughts to stop, so my intention was to sleep it off for like twelve hours. I was meant to have a counselling session on Monday, which I was looking forward to, and was meant to see my psychiatrist and care coordinator on Tuesday. The thing I can't explain is why I took so many pills (it would have taken a fraction of how many I took to put me to sleep). I actually have no recollection of Monday or Tuesday but I spent Monday - Friday in hospital because my little brother called an ambulance on Monday (I didn't tell anyone I overdosed, just went to sleep and woke up on Monday 'acting drunk' - was falling all over the place and not making sense at all). On Monday, I was told that I told the paramedics and doctors that I wish I hadn't woken up. Since I got discharged on Friday, I've been pretty suicidal, but today I had an enjoyable few hours cleaning and feel achieved even though I actually didn't do much.

This is why I can't even ask for help... I have nothing to say. Well, aside from school. That's probably one of the main reasons, but it's so insignificant and selfish that I'd be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal, because it shouldn't be. But it really is. Still, if I don't want help, I want the easy way out.



I guess I have walking depression, but I can still laugh and smile all day. The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife: if it exists, I go to hell and I'm fucked. If it doesn't exist, I just wasted what isn't even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void. I don't feel sad, but I don't want to live either. If you gave me a gun a week ago, I would have pulled the trigger. I don't know if my friends still like me, I'm probably annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was about 12 I had thoughts about suicide, I was severely depressed and it became the norm for me to think about it daily - although I never planned on acting on it, then. Through the years my periods of depression came and went, sometimes for a month and once or twice for a full year (2012, 2016). Do to the fact I would think about this so often, it had normalised it in my head - or only now do I realised I normalised it. The past few months have been particularly bad for me. I've lost my job that I loved, have had to move out from my flat back to my parents and been diagnosed with ADHD. And I'm finding it really fucking difficult to find a job, or at least one that is as creatively fulfilling (I'm a designer). I've been processing a lot of things recently - and have been thinking about it a lot - not with any intention. It's now affecting me in my day-to-day - I find it really hard to find motivation because at the back of my head I feel like thats where it could end up, its inevitable, its been staring at me running through my mind for all these years and I just never acknowledged it so.   


Ontop of that, something changed last night. I had been thinking about it alot before I go sleep, I cant seem to help it it just happens. I have always processed it alot, but not with any intention. Last night when I was lying in bed, it was like a wave or something and I dont know what happened but all of a sudden I became completely comfortable with it. Like, 100%.   


I don't plan on acting on it, but I'm finding it really hard to shift this 'inevitability' from front of mind. And **that** scares me.   


Does any one else get this, lifetime bombardment of thoughts and fear of in the inevitable? Is this fucking normal?   


Sorry if this is all muddled up and disjointed - I'm literally throwing it all down as it comes to my head.

10534,"I don't know what to do with myself anymore.Although I've never been diagnosed, I know I've suffering from depression and even suicidal thoughts since middle school. Now I'm just shy of turning 22, never been able to hold job for long thanks to crippling anxiety, no longer in school, and have barely any money. My sister is a nurse and my brother is in school to become a doctor, so that makes me the disappointing member of the family.

I feel so useless and unable to do anything and its gotten to a point where its a daily battle just to want to get out of bed and piss. These last few months I've felt completely depleted of any kind of motivation. The only reason I've never actually tried to end myself is because my desire to create and write novels has been the only thing these past years to outweigh my desire to be done with this constant suffering.

 I pretty much just stay home most of the time looking after our five dogs, only one of which I actually like. Thanks to seemingly perpetual rain, its been constantly wet and muddy outside and every god damn time I clean this fucking house those fucking dogs track more shit inside. Anything they dirty up or break is instantly my fault or responsibility to replace. (sorry, this part was more of a rant)

It is getting harder and harder to want to live for anything anymore. Eating and drinking have become a nuisance to me. The only real money to my name of recent--a $5000 inheritance from my departed grandfather--and I just had a family member basically tell me to forget about it and let my mom have it as recompense for living in her house. Any hopes and aspirations I have seem too unrealistic and impossible to achieve. I've practically given up on feeling in control of my life. The few hobbies I have (reading, writing, and video games) have become too strenuous to really enjoy anymore.

If I may use an example from Dark Souls to try to illustrate how I feel, its like being at Sens Fortress, trapped between two swinging pendulums on the last sliver of health with no estus or humanity and no bonfire in sight. No matter how much I cry out, there is no answer.

The past couple of weeks have been some of the most rough in my life, and that is saying so much. Every thing is crumbling around me. My mind is broken. 

I had been afraid that I pushed my dearest friend away. I've been intense lately, and I have not too many other people that I can open up to. I know I'm too much. I know that -- all I do is throw sick weight onto my loved one's shoulders. 

I've been watching videos of people dying. Suicides are my favorite, and especially ones with guns. I've gotten into murder videos, freak accidents, and torture. Never -- never have I liked this sort of thing. Seeing hurt has always made me sick. But I love it now. It is so soothing and pleasurable to watch these videos. It is my only release. Drugs/meds have always just been cheap masks that didn't make me feel real pleasure, but when I watch all of this suffering and gore, I am actually calm. 

I'm so filled with hatred. I want to hurt everyone who crosses me. I want these people to hurt! Every fucking day they hurt me. They are always pinning me down and SCREAMING IN MY EARS! I can't get quite anywhere. Everyone's feeling are forced onto me. I just want them to stop it. I want the eyes to leave from me. I've never been in a fight, and believe me I have had opportunity! I've never hurt anyone. But I want to bash and break all of these people who make me feel like complete shit. 

I opened up about this to my friend. And I think I have scared her off. I didn't even give all of these details, but I needed to get this off of my back. I wanted the person I care about the most to know that I am completely breaking. 

What's wrong with me? Why do I lived with the constant urge to end my life? And now -- violence is pounding in my head. And now -- I think I have really turned my friend away from me.

I suffered a lot of injustice.I was diagnosed with autism when I was 18, before I just wasn't myself. The primary school was okay, I was still able to function fairly socially and I had quite a few friends. I was almost never bullied. High school was hell, I did not have any friends and you could see on my face that I was very bothered by the environment (I always looked angry). I could not function at all socially, people became angry / frustrated with me because having a conversation was not really going and never could / dared to say something in class and thus became a target of bullying. People wondered several times what was wrong with me, but I didn't know it myself (but it was my autism). The last 2 years of high school I was completely isolated from the rest and severely depressed, social just did not work at all. People were walking over me, I was quite anxious at school. As I describe it, living with autism without knowing it is like you are using a device without knowing how to use it because you miss the user manual, and i was kind of like a zombie. By the way, I did finish school. At My follow-up education, I also had no friends and it was a repetition exercise, but even worse, not much difference was also bullied. And when I was done with that I was at home for a year, I didn't want anything. Then I talked to the doctor who had me diagnosed for autism through someone. And then all the puzzle pieces fell into place, it feels like I've missed a part of my life.

We’re both 23 and we went to visit some friends our age. Theyre about to move into a house together, but we just ended our lease without anywhere else to go so we’re living in her parents basement since the beginning of this month. She told me how she thought i would have an IT job but i was too depressed to move some days in school so i stopped working on my degree. I was working at best buy and when i moved closer to her i stayed at lyft for a while and when i finally applied to the best buy near where we live now corona lockdowns started and they didnt hire me. She talked about how exhausting it is to have dated me since we were 17 and having had to deal with my depression the whole time. She doesnt know how to help me when im miserable. Neither do i. 

Im going to therapy soon. I did it when i was a teenager but i stopped going. I dont know why. I dont remember a lot of events during times where i’m in an episode. I only did an intake session so far and they diagnosed me with persistant depressive disorder. Just saying that i’ve always been depressed and that i probably always will be. My first real session is in 2 more weeks. My depressive episodes usually only last 2 or 3 weeks so i should be stable by the time i get there. Until then nothing makes me happy. Ive tried talking to what little friends i have and they didnt seem interested in talking to me. One decided she didnt want to hang out as i walked up to her door last night.

I've been looking for a better job for well over a year now and I can't even get anyone to look at my resume. Ive been applying to several jobs a day, I actually have my default tabs set to job boards that I search and apply on in my spare time. Since I started I have has 4 interviews but they offered me less that I am making now even with my hours and responsibilities being cut.

I want to work so bad it is literally killing me inside that no-one will even look at my resume, or won't offer me a living wage.

I just found our that my rent is going up. One of my bills has also doubled because of a late fee since I couldn't afford to pay it on time. I am just so done. I hate myself and I hate my life but kost of all I hate living. For the first time since I moved out on my own I wasn't able to pay rent this month and my roommate had to make up the difference. It's looking like that will happen again next month and on top of that I have no idea how I can afford to pay my bills now. My savings is gone, cost of living is rising, and I am just a burden on those around me.

I'm tired of being a burden on others and I'm tired of working a dead end job that I despise knowing that no matter how hard I try I will never get out of it. I'm going to end it. My dad has inherited some guns over the years, he doesn't like using them, so he just keeps them locked up. I know how to get in to the safe.

3652,"PainI have lived in pain in one way or another since I was born. Never got to know my father, he was killed in Vietnam when I was 8 months old. Molested by a neighbor for years in my early teens. Battled alcohol and drug addictions through my 20's. Two failed marriages, to many failed careers to count. Diagnosed with prostate cancer 2 years ago. Spent a year having my body ravaged by radiation and chemo plus a couple surgerys. The cancer treatment has left me broken and in constant pain.  Not sure which is worse these days, the mental or physical pain. 

I have tried and tried to live a happy life, but it just never works out. I have unrealistic expectations of what life should be I guess. I am a complete failure as a son, a brother, a father and a husband. I have tried to keep hope for the future alive, but all hope is to me now is torture. 

I was talking with a co-worked last week and it finally hit me, all the things I had given up or put off so I could do what was right by my family will now never be realized. My body is broken and can never be fixed. I lost all hope that day.  I tried to explain it to my wife, she basically said ""so what, your not the only one"". 

I guess she's right, who gives a shit what I want. I am only here to make money to pay bills so that other may live and dream. 

so tired of the pain, so tired of being alone in my head. 

Wish I had the strength to end it all, but I dont. Feel too guilty for the pain I know it would cause. I have people the love and care for me, just dont care for myself anymore and they cant understand my pain. I dont kill myself because I dont want to burden my wife and sons with what it would cause them even though I know they would all be better off without me. 

I am an anchor around my wifes neck, holding her back, ruining her life. I have nothing left to offer my sons expect as a cautionary tail of how not to live. I am nothing but a financial and emotional burden to those around me.

6805,"my boyfriend wont dress up as a grinch I have a Grinch fetish. My boyfriend knows about this and for the most part accepts it. He isn't crazy about it and doesn't really get it but he at least tries which is all I ask. He'll sometimes read the book to me to set the mood, or if he's really feeling kinky tell me ""You're a mean one"" in the heat of the moment. He's even begrudgingly come around to at least playing one of the three versions of the film every time we do the deed (although we tend to stay away from the live-action one because it's too much for me).

The thing is, I don't want to hear about the Grinch or listen to the Grinch or watch the Grinch. I want to be fucked by the Grinch. And for the record this is common among women. The Grinch's bulging sack of toys to me (and many others) is what a Mack truck is to Cardi B. The fact that he's good with dogs and experienced trauma at a young age makes me want that long, fuzzy dick even more.

My boyfriend asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told him straight up. I told him to put on the greenest, silkiest Grinch costume he could find, kidnap me from my bed on Christmas Eve, and then ravage me in front of the Christmas tree.

He flat out refused. Said it was too weird for him. I was literally begging this man to let this pussy save Christmas and he was like nah, I'm good. It ended up turning into a fight where he admitted he only gave into my initial Grinch kinks to placate me and was still uncomfortable about the fact that I had moaned ""Grinch"" during sex a few weeks ago, but only because his song was playing in the background.

So he's drawn a line. And if I don't drop the Grinch fetish (which as I said is incredibly common among women but sadly taboo) he's done for good. I don't want to lose him over this. But it's really hard for me to see past my sexual proclivities especially during Christmas season.

15253,"my life has been going so badly and i just fucking hate it dont give awards or shit, im not deserving of them and it wont fucking help.

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like my life has just been going so badly

the reason im posting this is because i dont have a therapist, im afraid to ask my parents if i can have sessions, and i just need to get this out

recently ive been thinking about suicide

it started in september, when school started.

most of my classes were a bit hard to get to on time, and the teachers seemed confused, but all of that was expected. it didnt seem too different from what you would normally get amidst a pandemic 

after about a week, i had realized that all my teachers were assigning quite a bit of work outside of school, and it seemed sorta normal. normally in school, we would have our in-class assignments in every class, with some homework every now and then for each class, and nightly homework for math

&amp;#x200B;

but it was ok

&amp;#x200B;

now i get ""asynchronous work"", (which is the most bullshit nickname for homework) almost every day, for every class.

i have trouble keeping up with the amount of work im given, and as im writing this, i should probably be doing my homework

my family gets mad when im late for dinner

i have to give up the only times i get to interact with my friends, just to rewrite french statements i already knew from 6th grade

i rewatched an episode of bojack horseman called ""the view from halfway down"" which you may or may not be familiar with

in the episode, they include tons of references to things regarding why people commit suicide, how other people see it, why people don't do it, why you shouldn't, etc

thats the only fucking thing thats helped

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like theres nothing good left in life

people i look up to are dead

our current generation gets skin grafts and drinks bleach for views on tiktok

why the hell should i stay

i shouldnt have to be here to watch myself suffer

my family gets annoyed at me

my friends wouldnt understand

so i dont feel like theres anyone left for me

or anything good left in the world

ill probably delete this at some point

5980,"I survived last night. If you're hurting tonight, know that you're NOT alone. i've been fighting with depression for most of my life. i've had my moments where its gotten worse, gotten better, and then when i least expected it...it got worse all over again.

last night i thought it was all i could take. i didn't want to die....but i didn't want to live. i wrote a note, did what i thought i needed to do, and laid in bed. i turned on the television to a funny tv show, so i thought i could laugh a few times before it would all be over. i fought with the idea in the back of my mind that i didn't want to do this, and i was scared. but i fell asleep...too tired and exhausted to worry anymore. all i knew was that i did want to live, but i thought it was too late for me.

16 hours later i woke up. the people i had texted the night of my attempted suicide still hadn't responded. those people i reached out to hadnt responded. but i was breathing, and i still am. 

now more than ever, i want to live. i want to get better. i don't know what changed within me, but i feel more hopeful then i ever had. that night, i recognized what had triggered me, and now i made steps to stop that from happening again. i'm not 100% healed and cured, and i know i'll have my relapses back into depression...but now for the first time i feel like i'm strong enough alone to face it and get through it.

i know i'm just some faceless person on the internet....but if you're hurting and you're alone and sad....there are people that love you and want to help. i want to help...and i care about you because i know what it feels like. its devastating and it hurts more than any physical injury i've ever sustained. if anyone needs to talk, or just wants someone to listen, i promise i will.

10476,"Practicing for the endSo I've been practicing hanging myself on a daily basis when my girlfriend isn't home. I've also been constricting rope around my neck to see what it feels like to drift out of conciousness.

For the last year I've been vividly reliving all my worst moments and reacting to those memories with painful emotions. I remember when my father was in a coma and I didn't visit him because I thought he wasn't going to make it. I just couldn't take seeing him like that. He pulled through but I feel awful every day. I remember when I broke up with a girlfriend when I was 16 because she was acting pretty crazy, but her mother was dying. That's just fucking awful.

My life has just been a series of events where I've had the opportunity to be brave but have instead reacted with cowardice.

I realise the irony of contuing the trend of being a coward with existing by taking the ""easy way out"".

I'm worried I've become too involved in living and that it would definitely hurt many people when I'm gone. I also think it would be for the better.

I struggle with the worst intrusive thoughts and I feel like a terrible human being. I haven't seen my sisters in years and I feel I'm drifiting further from reality everyday. Before lockdown at least I felt human by going to work and pretending to be something. Now I feel like nothing.

There are awful things that happened to my older sister. My family never told me. I found out recently from a family friend. She was drugged and raped by a group of men from my hometown.

Since then I've been revisiting the memories of the past and trying to see them with this new knowledge and it makes things make a lot of sense.

I was always afraid to go to a psychiatrist because I assumed that her change in behaviour was due to the medication she was given. Now it makes sense that she became seemigly hollow and numb as a result of the bad things that happened to her and not the medication.

This gives me hope that perhaps medication can save me. I'm just finding it very hard to make that step.

4098,"I think I might try to overdose again...Last month I tried ODing on my meds, but didn't have nearly enough left and just ended up getting high. I'll finally be able to get refills on the 12th, and I'm thinking about attempting it again, possibly adding alcohol this time if I can get my hands on some to ensure I don't survive.

I'm just tired of being a fuck up, a burden, a disappointment, a failure, a worthless mentally ill piece of shit who just pushes people away. I recently pushed away the girl of my dreams, who I loved (and still love) more than anything in this world. I wish I had been a better boyfriend, I wish I hadn't been so codependent, impatient, negative. She just wanted me to be her happy escape from all of the bs in her life, and I failed her.

I'm really considering attempting suicide again once I get my refills. I hate this endless cycle of me opening up and getting closer to people and just becoming a burden and pushing them away eventually. I loved my girl more than life itself, I cared about her more than I've ever cared about anyone or anything, and now she won't even talk to me... and it's all my fault. She gave me plenty of chances, and I just kept making the same mistakes. 

I'm tired of being alone. I spent more than my fair share of time alone and miserable before I met her, and it hurts so much more now because I had my dream girl and of course I fucked it up in spectacular fashion... I don't want to be alone again, and I just seem to push away any friends I manage to make or anyone I get close to. I'm tired of this endless cycle... and to top it all off, pretty much everything about me is pathetic. I'm 20 years old with pretty much no life, and little to no life skills. Hell, I'm still trying to figure out what my ex even saw in me in the first place.

5426,"A rant about something I'd loved but left because of circumstances:) This is gonna be a long rant because nobody irl really cares at this point. I apologise in advance if it upsets anyone or gets too negative- I'm stuck in a miserable moment right now.

Have you ever had that one thing that you loved but left behind yet still think of Every. Fucking. Day? 

It would be tennis for me. I stopped playing it three- three and a half years back and I still miss it every single day. I changed academies thrice before ultimately leaving the sport altogether even though I loved it so fucking much and was lost without playing it. It started to get associated with unpleasant memories and pathetic conversations and just... it was bad.

I've tried going into another sports like swimming, boxing, mma but... ever have that one thing that ruined you for everything else? Those sports were great but they couldn't quite match up to the spot that tennis had, and will always have, in my heart.

Every time when I score good or win an award or something all of my relatives start asking what I want for a gift, that I have to say the name and they'll get it and internally I'm just like ""Please get me a good coach. Someone who isn't fucking four hours away or cares about how much I weigh or will go to the extent of breaking my racquet because I didn't buy one from their relative."" 

Literally all I want is ONE coach to actually care about me and my game. Who doesn't give a fuck about me being a girl or that I am a kilogram above/below what they want me to weigh- who is genuinely invested in improving my game. I will honestly go to hell and back for them but... 😂fuck man just ine nice coach.

I really can't blame anyone, my family (both immediate and extended) tried. I'm very very thankful that they cared enough but the distance was too much to travel in a single day, going and returning. 

I still play once every few months. Usually I'm just in my room shadowing movements. Sometimes I get in these bitter and sad spells 😅 but y'know, shit happens and that's that.

14573,"I want to die, but I don't know if I can go through with itI’m posting this here because I’m not sure who I want to talk to, if anyone. I’ve been struggling with depression for a little while now, probably 2 months, though looking back I realise it was a pretty steady decline over more than a month. After a while I isolated myself and haven’t seen many people. I don’t enjoy anything anymore; everything seems like work. I keep thinking about suicide – how would I do it, should I do it, how bad could it be? I have a plan but it’s not very good, but today I came very close to going through with it. If my family didn’t exist I’d probably not be here right now, but I’m not sure I could put them through that. Fundamentally I think I’ve realised that I just don’t want to be in control of myself anymore, but I don’t want to face the consequences for anything. I don’t want to exist, but I don’t want to do something that I’ll have to then explain. I just want to die peacefully, now.

I also don’t really want to talk to anyone. I’m tired of talking to people. I want someone to drag these feelings out of me, to show they care. I don’t want to burden someone with this if they don’t want it. I went to the doctor yesterday and spoke about some of what I was feeling, but I wasn’t very forthcoming and I don’t want to go back and say that I didn’t tell the whole truth about how I was feeling. A lot of places recommend calling some kind of service, and frankly that sounds terrible to me. I don’t want to call anyone or speak to them on the phone. I guess some of it is that I don’t want to help myself. I don’t care, and trying to help myself just sounds like work.  It would be so much easier just to end my suffering. I don’t really know what to do.

I don’t want to talk to any of my friends because I worry that I’ll just get a barrage of questions and judgements that will just make me feel worse. It’s why I haven’t spoken with all but one of them in weeks. I suppose I don’t really know what I want, but maybe you can help.",suicide,"i want to die, but i don t know if i can go through with itim posting this here because im not sure who i want to talk to, if anyone ive been struggling with depression for a little while now, probably 2 months, though looking back i realise it was a pretty steady decline over more than a month after a while i isolated myself and havent seen many people i dont enjoy anything anymore everything seems like work i keep thinking about suicide  how would i do it, should i do it, how bad could it be? i have a plan but its not very good, but today i came very close to going through with it if my family didnt exist id probably not be here right now, but im not sure i could put them through that fundamentally i think ive realised that i just dont want to be in control of myself anymore, but i dont want to face the consequences for anything i dont want to exist, but i dont want to do something that ill have to then explain i just want to die peacefully, now  i also dont really want to talk to anyone im tired of talking to people i want someone to drag these feelings out of me, to show they care i dont want to burden someone with this if they dont want it i went to the doctor yesterday and spoke about some of what i was feeling, but i wasnt very forthcoming and i dont want to go back and say that i didnt tell the whole truth about how i was feeling a lot of places recommend calling some kind of service, and frankly that sounds terrible to me i dont want to call anyone or speak to them on the phone i guess some of it is that i dont want to help myself i dont care, and trying to help myself just sounds like work  it would be so much easier just to end my suffering i dont really know what to do  i dont want to talk to any of my friends because i worry that ill just get a barrage of questions and judgements that will just make me feel worse its why i havent spoken with all but one of them in weeks i suppose i dont really know what i want, but maybe you can help ",406
531,"BreakupIm 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it. When I was trying to get sober I thought about killing myself a lot for the same reason. All this work to do and no energy. Ive come to the conclusion that doing work, whether for money or personal growth is the way to being ol and somewhat of a whole person but I just dont know how. I have all this work to do and I dont have the energy or give a shit enough about anything to get started. I know objectively what is supposed to work. ""Dont talk to her"" ""Get work done"" ""Distract yourself"" ""Get exercise"" Has anyone been in a situation like this? Where you found the person you thought was the right one for you and then one day it just all fell apart? She still loves me and I her but we cant be together and its just getting harder as time goes bye.

4890,"I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm tryingI'm.... I don't even know how to write this. Let alone start it. 

I bought a journal. A little black one. I'm going to try to write down all the reasons why I shouldn't die. I can't think of very many right now but I'm hoping it will help. 

I feel like I'm divided into two parts, one that wants to survive and be helped, and one that doesn't think I even deserve getting another shot. Right now the larger part of me wants to die. Badly. So fucking badly. It knows I cannot fix or even outweigh my mistakes.

But the existence of the smaller part, the part that is saying ""no, there is a reason you were once loved, there is a person inside of you that you once were, even if she's gone you can make her again"". That's the part that bought the journal. The part that scheduled a therapist appointment. 

God but it's so difficult. I know now that I have to do this on my own. Everyone has had the best intentions when they try to help but it just made it more stressful. Their help set me off into a panic attack. I know I have to be the reason I stay alive, otherwise its just out of guilt. Right now all I have is myself and I absolutely loathe myself. 

I didn't even get out of bed yesterday. I just laid there. I don't want to go to class. I don't have any friends here, and I don't want people to have to be my friend because I'm a terrible, selfish friend disguised as a nice person. I spend most of my time struggling to stay distracted from my thoughts and my memories. 

I'm exhausted. I'm just so tired. Keeping myself alive is taking every single ounce of energy I have. And that's for the bare minimum. Actually taking care of myself demands so much more energy, energy I'm not even sure I'm willing to give to someone I hate so much. My brain sometimes latches onto different phrases and repeats them incessantly. Right now the phrase is ""I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying."" I don't really know which way I mean by that.

I don't want to say anything but keeping my feelings down for the past couple years has been torture and it's getting to a point where I just have to tell her. So for one, should I say anything? And 2 if I do, would what's below be acceptable?

""I wish it weren't the case. I can see how desperately you don't want it. I see it in your eyes when I smile around you, but not saying it for the past 3 years has been killing me from the inside out. I've had feelings for you for a while now. I just need to get that out. I love you and I don't think those feelings will fade anytime soon. God knows I've tried to stop it or ignore it but it's just been eating away at me. And it's not even that I don't want to love you, it's just I know that it's not what you want. So I'm sorry. I hope we can continue to be friends. I hope it doesn't burn any bridges. I truly hope we can still have a bond without a lingering awkwardness. I don't think I could stand a life without you. If you need some space from me for a while then I'd totally understand, but please just know that I will always be there for you. I'll always be rooting for you, even if it has to be from afar. You are genuinely one of the best people I've ever met and I'm so lucky to be able to call myself your friend. I'm really sorry. I've tried to keep it down and not let it get in the way but everytime I talk to you it's like a pressure builds up in my stomach to force out all my feelings for you and it's torture to hold it back, so here's me not holding it back anymore.

My parents and my brothers hate me right now and called me a disgrace to the family. They compare me to my cousins who are also my age and in professional schools. They think I have a disability cause I’m a bad student, I don’t.

She even went as far as to say that if she died from stress, it would be all my fault and her death would be on my hands. They think I don’t care about anyone or anything because I always seem “relaxed” but what they don’t see is the nights I stay up until 4 in the morning thinking how much a failure of I am and how I know I’m a disgrace. I do care, I do want a good future, I do want to make my family proud. But I feel as if nothing can be done for me. All hope is lost for me.

I don't know if I have a psychosis or what is wrong with me. The only person I've talked with regularly in the past year is telling me I'm a worthless whore and if I died it would be better for everyone. I have nobody but my cat here and people are avoiding and ignoring me.

13444,"Enjoy the small things.Okay, so I think we all need a break from the depressing stories that only end up everyone feel worse. So here it goes.




If you're ever thinking about commiting suicide or harming yourself in any way, here are some things to help.

1) The 24 hour rule. When you're thinking about ending your life just make yourself wait a day (or even two or three if you want) and see if you still feel like ending it all.



2) Talk to someone. I know that *everyone* tells you to get help or talk to a therapist, but it does help. They wont magically make you feel happy, but with a little work on your part you will feel better. 



3) Listen to music. Make sure it's not too depressing, but also not too cheerful. my favorite song to listen to when I start thinking about suicide is Misguided Ghosts by Paramore. Find the song(s) that 
make(s) you feel better.



4) Enjoy the small things. Think of all the little things you would miss about life. Write down all the stuff you would miss **no matter how small** and keep adding to the list every night as you think of stuff. Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic and think about things you would miss about life, but even then you can read what you wrote before and remind yourself . Here are some of the small things that I enjoy:

* When I try to go on the Depression subreddit and I accidentally type in derpression. That always makes me smile.
* (for Americans) The fourth of July, I love how blowing stuff up gets everyone together. 
* Grammar Nazis. Most people hate them but I think it's hilarious when people get butthurt over someone correcting their grammar.
* Drama. While I hate drama, I love all the ridiculous reasons people will come up with to be mad about.
* B movies on SyFy and Chiller. I love those really cheesy movies like **Mantis** or **Kingdom of the Spiders**.
* I love people's reactions when they find out that my favorite movies are **Nosferatu**, **Jeepers creepers**, and **The Mist**.

This isn't real  
'Cause you leave in a month  
And I'm fiending for something to feel  
When you hold me  
Know you know me down to my core  
This is the calm before the storm  
Mentioned that someone else gon' need you more  
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong  
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me  
Along for me

And I fell apart in that bed  
What we built isn't me

Oh, and I took you to rosier

No, I gotta figure me out (oh-ooh, yeah, uh)

15537,"Last night, I got so pissed off I fainted. I have never had that before. I think I should go to the doctor.(21M) I won't go into detail, but I've been suppressing my deepest angers since junior year of high school and it seems like I have more to be pissed off about after high school than I was in.

Last night, while driving, I was so worked up; the most worked up I've been since I can remember, that I fucking passed out (not road-rage related). I was driving in a 25(mph) road, going 30; I was ungodly amount of pissed, but other than pounding on the center console a handful of times, I suppressed my deepest angers. Shortly after that, everything in me seemed to be shutting off. I knew something was wrong, so I pressed the brakes and pounded on the center console some more to try and stay conscious until I could get the car to a full stop. Everything went blank for several seconds. Just nothing.

I regained consciousness a couple seconds later, with the vehicle still rolling at 5mph. I figured it was a short amount of time between falling out of consciousness and back in because I wasn't very far between when I passed out and when I woke up. I do remember waking up and nearly missing the corner though. It was a curvy road. I drove the rest of the way home safely.

In addition I got several nightmares last night and when I woke up, I was emotional, my entire chest area hurt, and I wreaked.

This has got to be the last straw. I got to get some sort of professional help. I don't care if it's something as simple as antidepressants. I had taken 0 pills for my depression because I never got prescribed any, and anytime I try to plead for help to my family, they often tell me that I'm overreacting and I have nothing to be sad about. I have to do something, though. I don't want to kill myself (yet), and if I don't die via killing myself, I won't die from depression, but many health problems ensue when the depression is heavy enough, and this is the heaviest it's ever been.

I'm gonna rest now; hope everyone else is doing okay.",suicide,"last night, i got so pissed off i fainted i have never had that before i think i should go to the doctor 21m i won t go into detail, but i ve been suppressing my deepest angers since junior year of high school and it seems like i have more to be pissed off about after high school than i was in  last night, while driving, i was so worked up the most worked up i ve been since i can remember, that i fucking passed out not road rage related  i was driving in a 25 mph road, going 30 i was ungodly amount of pissed, but other than pounding on the center console a handful of times, i suppressed my deepest angers shortly after that, everything in me seemed to be shutting off i knew something was wrong, so i pressed the brakes and pounded on the center console some more to try and stay conscious until i could get the car to a full stop everything went blank for several seconds just nothing  i regained consciousness a couple seconds later, with the vehicle still rolling at 5mph i figured it was a short amount of time between falling out of consciousness and back in because i wasn t very far between when i passed out and when i woke up i do remember waking up and nearly missing the corner though it was a curvy road i drove the rest of the way home safely  in addition i got several nightmares last night and when i woke up, i was emotional, my entire chest area hurt, and i wreaked  this has got to be the last straw i got to get some sort of professional help i don t care if it s something as simple as antidepressants i had taken 0 pills for my depression because i never got prescribed any, and anytime i try to plead for help to my family, they often tell me that i m overreacting and i have nothing to be sad about i have to do something, though i don t want to kill myself yet , and if i don t die via killing myself, i won t die from depression, but many health problems ensue when the depression is heavy enough, and this is the heaviest it s ever been  i m gonna rest now hope everyone else is doing okay ",404
2630,"Never happyI used to be so happy when I was a child in school. My imagination was so big that I forgot everything else along with my bestfriend during that time. But time changed as I got older... I woke up when I was around 12 years old. It was all about girls, education and success all of sudden and I didnt understand it. I began feeling unhappy and have been it ever since. Im 21 btw. I was always the ""clown"" who made all my friends laugh and I laughed myself on the outside. But inside I was crying... I felt alone and unhappy. I had friends and a bestfriend yes. But I was still completely alone once I walked home to my house playing video games. When I got older I began loosing my friends and became more an outsider in my school. They invited me to parties but I began making lies to skip it and so I spend so many weekends alone.  *I have missed out on so many epic parties,* I have missed out so many epic parties and experiences because of my shyness and lies. As I went to highschool it got worse. I only saw my classmates in school and to a few parties. I was still the funny guy though but that was all. During senior some in my class begin making fun of me for never having talked to a girl before. I just laughed with them. But deep inside it was another knife to my heart of all the failures I have made. I realised I will never get to experience what my friends experienced. The normal social life, always spending time with the guys, going out and hooking girls. After I graduated I lost all contact with them cuz I skipped them. Im an selfish asshole and that have destroyed my life.

Now I am on the edge of suicide. I dont fit in this world. I make jokes of everything and make people laugh. But the only person who doesnt laugh is myself. Where is the joy? Where is my succes? Where is my happiness?  

But I have accepted reality and find that hope was only a peaceful illusion.... Now acceptance, still lost and no idea where next... Am I happy? Never. That's just another illusion, I'm conscious of reality....for now, that's enough but not for long.....

5058,"I actually wanna commit die So I'm like 15 years old and have an Asian family and yes this is where this shit sucks.
Its more like being born anywhere where I live sucks, I'm forced to study and there is no other career option rather than being an engineer or a doctor.
What makes it worse is I have a mega nerd TWIN SISTER who keeps studying like 24/7, this shit makes my parents expect me to be also studying like  25 hours a day.

BUT I WAS HANDELING ALL OF THIS BS UNTIL my parents decided to take my laptop (and I'm FR never getting it back). But to be honest I'm not at all offended by this but rather super sad, as if u would have been on my place this would have easily made sense as I do have a phone of my own and basically there's a big amount of points I think make sense. And yea I didn't have a premium account on mc so basically I could not enjoy really playing on servers BUT I ACTUALLY BOUGHT AN ACCOUNT WITH MY OWN FUCKING MONEY THAT I HID FROM MY PARENTS FOR LIKE AN YEAR NOW.

I have like a 1000 more things (but I won't explain it as I'm sure basically like 10 people will read this till the end that) I have related to that laptop and mostly being that I'm gonna lose my friends that I made on discord, I actually ended up meeting peeps who had like the same interests as me and we enjoyed playing csgo, minecraft, skribll, among us, fall guys, live streaming like random shit and stuff that I never imagined enjoying with a friend on an internet.

And tbh watching subreddits like r/mademesmile and other wholesome subreddits make me feel even worse as to seeing how strangers help each other and here my family pressurizes me to study take up a career and gaming is a crime.

I basically have a true redditor live but make it even worse. 
btw I meant no hate towards my family rather I'm super pissed, I didn't explain like everything so it must be super unclear what I'm actually trying to say.

2789,"I just want to ventI've been depressed my whole life, and became suicidal 2 years ago. I've tried one shoddy attempt at suffocating myself once with a plastic bag and rope, but that was it so far. I do fantasize about it all the time, daily, even as I type this. I tried to talk to my dad about it  several times, but he thinks its just bullshit. I talked to my sister about it a lot, but she always seemed to just brush it off because  she went through a depressive streak and slashed her wrists, but got over it somehow. 


She went and had a kid with an abusive drug addicted criminal, and now she is going through a nasty custody battle with him. I am being supportive, listening to her, being understanding, reassuring her, basically just trying to help her out as best as I can, and not stress her out. I also help her pay for some minor things and help babysit my nephew, as well go to court with her to give her a moral boost. She moved back in with me and our abusive parents, and I tried my damn hardest to make sure they focused most of their crap on me instead of her. She was only able to last a month with them. 


So we go to court last week, nothing really happens but the crazy guy's lawyer scares the shit out of my sister, so she calls me hysterically crying saying she wants kill herself. I somehow manage to calm her down and cheer her up pretty quickly, we talk some more, and she hangs up. And now here is the problem, ever since that phone call I get extremely angry when I get my suicidal thoughts. It's like those thoughts have been a comforting thing for me, something I could control. When now I can't think about them, because if I go and off myself my sister and nephew will have no one to help them. Anyone have any advice? This shit makes my angry just typing it.

10811,"I had never been happier in my life. Now I've never felt worse.Last December, I met a boy who I fell in love with so quickly. He and I dated for seven months, everything seemed perfect, he even encouraged me to go to college near him so we could continue dating through then.

So I enrolled in a college south of his; my job was going well, I was excited for college, I was excited for everything.

And out of nowhere, he left. He dumped me, told me he just didn't love me anymore, that as cliche as it was, he wanted a fresh start for college.

Now, I'm failing out of college, the boy I'm in love with now has ghosted me, my family barely has room for me in my old house, I have no motivation, no money, and no plan. I have never felt so fucking empty and pointless in my life. 

I don't want to exist anymore. I thought I had someone who loved me and wanted to be with me forever, *he said he did, he fucking insisted*. And he lied. I don't feel like I can trust anyone, I don't feel like I have anything left to live for.

The boy I love now stopped talking to me. He told me he wasn't sure what he wants, and then stopped talking to me. My heart aches because I opened up, he was my best friend and I fell in love with him over these past four months, and now he won't even fucking speak to me. I see no point, no fucking point in any of this shit. 

All I want is for this fucking lonely, heartbreaking nightmare to end. I can't take this shit anymore. I can't be alone, but I can't manipulate people into sticking around so I haven't told them how hopeless I'm feeling. I just can't do this anymore. I'm so fucking alone, and there is no point in existing if I'm alone. I'm such a piece of shit, and I'm just... I'm just done.

8268,"My friends have abandoned meI know. It's all my fault isn't it? But I can't control myself  


In my last post on this subreddit, I said that I had anger issues I couldn't control. It's gotten worse with the fights on our Discord server I don't start. My so called ""friends"" insult everything I do, badmouthing me behind my back. And they call me the hypocrite. Does this make them any better?  


I get it. I hurt people too much. It's not me hurting them mentally, because I can't control myself anymore. Anything can set me off, and being banned from the server helped a lot. When I saw them make fun of my attempts to change (I had been trying for a year and a half, made two great friends and had fun writing stories together), saying ""Her method of ""trying"" Is like a fat guy curling one rep per month and expecting for a change.""  


And that was coming from someone who stopped being friends with me for five years. He apparently knows what I've been trying to do.  


There's two friends I can trust. One has been through what I'm going through. I trust her completely, ranting when I need to and getting help from her. Slowly, this dark side of me is cracking.   


However, I'm still confused as to why they want me to feel remorse. They started an argument with me??? They knew full well this would end with me lashing out, but they continued pushing. When it was over, I didn't even know what I did, and I'm just confused as to what I've done. Nobody has told me anything, I'm going through my old screenshots of them badmouthing me, but it still doesn't answer my question.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still holding on to that hope that there's someone out there that can help me with this. But it's such a selfish thought, thinking someone would help me. That's what they think. My hypocritical ""friends"" who claim to care, but yet start arguments with me, and now hate me to hell.

9500,"[M18] Finally deciding to get my writing out there. I made a website and am unbelievably proud of myself right now! I've been writing all sorts of things for the past year or so and kind of just letting it let me heal and think deeper about certain things. It's done so much good for me mentally to get things out, I cannot even describe it.

I lost my grandpa, who lived with me, in December and writing (I was working on a pretty long piece already about \[something indescribable. Life, maybe?\] and I ended up incorporating my grief and emotions and processing his loss through the piece), writing helped a lot. Especially writing about memories that I can go back and read and remember him like he's still here...

That piece isn't posted anywhere yet. I'm still going over it and adding and editing and processing.. One day, probably soon, I'll release it. 

But that's just kind of a background to what this post is about. I made a writing website where I've posted most of my other pieces (and am always adding more, and eventually adding the one I mentioned above)! 

I used to be really into coding and put it down entirely a few months ago. I was making video games, not websites, so the fact that I made an entire website from the ground up makes me really, really proud!! It's nothing special, but I like it. And if any of you guys like reading or art, you'd maybe like what's on it.

I've described most of my writings as essays about ambiguous topics that would be inappropriate to write in the standard five-paragraph essay format, and are way more properly represented through fiction/storytelling. That's just some. Others I describe more like paintings (I cannot paint or draw for the life of me, so I use writing to 'paint'). I hope that makes sense. Don't worry if it doesn't.

Anyway, I've rambled too much. I'd love talking to literally anyone, feel free to message me or comment or anything you want. I appreciate it.

9683,"Suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem. Last post.I want my quote to resonate with existence itself. 

A lot of people act like they know how you truly feel, when in reality, they only believe what the majority says and it then becomes bias. These help methods, quotes, do not apply to this world. 

I find it beyond disrespectful for someone to pretend like they fucking know me and tell me this that, yadda, yadda like some bitch and girls I meet online. I've had people tell my that my opinions, morales and ideas don't matter and come off as ""negative"" so to speak. Let's just say I've met many bad people.

If you're plan is to argue with someone who want to kill themselves, you're practically killing them. Not to mention trolls. No one will ever know until they feel truly suicidal, it's just like eating a coconut or a rare fruit, no one is going to realize or give a shit because they're blind to it.

Anyways the meaning of this post, is I'm quitting this sub-reddit, my DMs are empty but I guess that's best, I've been in this vicious cycle of no one talking to me, but I think it's time to finally cut myself off from the world and trauma. This shit has gotten out of hand.

Just know two things.

1. If everyone else does it then I should!
2. If everyone else believes it then I should!

The most hated people in this world were the ones who tried making a difference. Demons are all around you remember that. Everything is about numbers, money, fame, people, groups, politics. Everything. I'll probably delete this soon anyways, I regret having any emotion. All it brings is hate, plus my PMs will be empty and hopefully they will because it's proof that I'm going. I've typed too much and wasted my time. 

FYI I have had no friends or anyone to talk to my entire life. Only bad people is all I had. Demons. 

When I go, it won't make a difference compared to living, just saying killing myself won't make any difference, I've already ran down every scenario. Nothing matters to me.

3902,"I am going to lose my health insuranceI am a wreck. I have been seeing therapists on and off for years for depression and anxiety. I have screwed up so many times. When I finished High School I tried college and flunked out, lying to my parents about it until the situation dictated that I couldn't keep hiding it. I worked for a few years at terrible retail places and was miserable. I finally was able to go back to school. I love learning, and I'm good at school, but I have trouble focusing sometimes and the last two semesters have been really tough. I'm 25 and my birthday is in a couple weeks. I still live with my parents, who have been notihng but supportive of me. They love me and try to understand and help, but this semester I've had more trouble and I'm flunkin out of a few of my classes like I did before. I don't want to disappoint them, I'm too old to screw up all over again. They don't deserve to have to deal witth this. The biggest problem is that once I turn 26 in a couple weeks my health insurance has to come from school, but that only happens if im full time and right now because of how I screwed up I'm at 3 classes instead of the required 4 for full time. I won't have health insurance to talk to my therapists or continue my medication.

I can't tell my parents about it. They deserve the honesty, but I'm such a horrible person I can't deal with telling them. I want to escape and not have to deal with it anymore, and it is totally selfish of me. They've given me so much and I do nothing but screw up and all I can think about is wanting to escape my own failings, leaving them to feel sad after I am gone. That just makes me feel even worse.

I was doing so well until this semester, but this was my last chance and I blew it.

My family has pushed me out because of college arguments and family problems. My mom and me got into a big fight my freshman year and nothing has been the same since. My uncle, who is a grade above me and who I grew up with, is praised for where he is going for college and what he does. Growing up asian and with a smart uncle made expectations high for me. When it comes to be it's like they don't care about me at all. A lot of my family went to my uncles graduation and celebrated. Only 2 of the family went to mine and that hurt. A lot actually.After high school I thought I had 2 close friends. I helped them through everything during high school breakups, family deaths, just about anything. But when I needed help they didn't do anything. All they would say is ""oh that sucks."" Recently my grandfather died and it hit me pretty hard. I told the both of them but they sorta just ignored me after I told them. I feel like a nuisance to them when ever I hang out with them so I haven't been talking to them much. I miss them I love them but if they don't want talk to me I don't want to force myself on them.

When I'm with people I'm social I like to talk and be active. But when I'm alone, I'm depressed. I used to take pills for it but I stopped taking them freshman year. I smoke a lot I drink a lot. I just don't care about living anymore. I don't want to live in pain anymore. I thought things would change after I graduated and they got worse.

I've just feel like a nuisance to everyone. My family will probably be better off without me. My sister can grow up without a brother but she's young she'll just think I went to college.

7339,"On a dark path, need some wordsI’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember and feeling suicidal lately. Tonight I took a huge potentially fatal dose of opiates, not with suicide intent but certainly a fuck it attitude.

My family is limited to parents and a very distant brother, they are totally dysfunctional and have a very cold sort of love for me. I had parents growing up not “loving” parents. I don’t have the same happy / supportive net that many do here, so in many ways this makes me feel lonely.

Friends, this is where I really struggle, I have a few close friends and a wide network of “friends”. Nobody to really hang out with and comfortably talk about problems though. It’s been this way my whole life. I get incredible anxiety and crushing loneliness on the weekends when I spend whole days alone because nobody bothers with me despite my extraordinary efforts.

Relationships, I had a very very intense one and felt happy for a brief period. I opened up to her like a book and she walked out on me crying on the floor of our empty house after the last of the stuff had been gone. She left to “go work on herself” and is now taking cocaine multiple days a week and hooking up with strangers. I haven’t seen her since. I haven’t met anyone else since, had the emotional energy to go on a date or, rather pathetically, managed to even muster the confidence to hook up with anyone.

I’ve been on a path of “things will get better if you work hard on yourself” for YEARS now. I’ve put my blood and soul into hobbies, gym, socialising, work. Where am I? The lowest mentally I’ve ever been. I moved city to try a fresh start, the same. At the end of the day the commonality is always ME. Maybe it’s my appearance, body language, something about me that just makes me “meh” to other people, some sort of background noise. Maybe my brain is dysfunctional and wasn’t meant to be happy, constantly overthinking and overanalysing. 

I used to be depressed but buoyed by bursts of hope driven life enthusiasm, now I feel so disillusioned that I dismiss the hope and every day feels like a chore.

561,"Confusion, suicide and a sick petI’ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. It’s different this time though because I truly feel I’m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it’s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn’t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I can’t trust my own brain, my mind. It’s the worst it’s ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. He’s going downhill and the doctors just figured out what’s going on but the situation is dire it’s probably too late. I don’t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime he’s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well I’m suicidal, I don’t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said it’s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. I’m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I don’t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he’s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless I’m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I don’t know if it’s good for him or me to keep doing this. I don’t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didn’t do everything I could.

3048,"I can't force myself to care anymoreSorry if this doesn't make sense, my memories from the last few months are a little broken. Can't really piece it together too well.  


A little over 7 months ago, I broke up with my long term highschool girlfriend in search of a more fulfilling life. When we got together, she didn't want me smoking weed anymore, so I stopped. I was a pothead of a sort, so this made me a little sad, but I decided it was worth it. So naturally, when we broke up, I started smoking again. What else should a highschool senior be doing? I smoked every single day for about 7 months, trying all sorts of new drugs along the way. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Opiates. Shrooms. LSD. MDMA. Cocaine. All sorts of fun stuff. I thought that they would give me a new perspective on life, but they only left me as a shell of the person I used to be. I graduated high school about 3 months after I broke up with her, and that's when my drug use really took off. I chose to attend college about 300 miles away from my hometown in an effort to start anew, to be a different person. But now, all I am is alone. I live in a huge city with no money, I'm on the verge of failing some important classes, and have nothing left. All I want is to not be me anymore. I don't want to be anyone. I just want to be nothing. The more and more that I wonder what else I could have been, the more and more it all hurts. All the cries for help, all the lonely nights, all the account overdrawal emails and antidepressants that never worked, they all contributed to who I am as a person today. I've tried to blame people for creating the monster that I am, but the only person there is to blame is me. I'm my own Dr. Frankenstein. After I tried to kill myself, I thought it best to seek out a therapist, and maybe some antidepressant medication. Therapy doesn't do jack shit, and the only thing I have to thank my medication for is my now nonexistent sex drive. Life is so fucking bland, and christ, it's fucking killing me.

4872,"I was an anti-masker and now have Covid-19 “If you want to see the rainbow, you have to put up with the rain”

- Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal -

Until a couple of weeks ago, I was an anti-masker. I live in Florida, and work in a restaurant; and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant, after months of not wearing one, that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask. My excuses were that it is hot. I am constantly running around and wearing a mask, I thought, would slow me down and make me uncomfortable. The funny thing is, I’d never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like. Let me tell you all, ITS NOT THAT BAD. Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren’t wearing it, but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others. I have taken a complete 180 on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before. Let me be clear. A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus. I work in an overcrowded restaurant, and even after wearing a mask every second at work, i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago. Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about. How my comfort used to overrule others’ safety. How I used to hate people pushing for masks, how annoying it was, and now how important it is. If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else’s, I think we would have a lot more lives saved. A mask doesn’t make you immune, but it does help. And refusing to wear one, going out partying, and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in. I wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can, and only go outside for things that are truly necessary.

I know that my “whims” to commit suicide always come at an inconvenient time to you. But I’ve been wanting and thinking of it since middle school and what? I’ve known you two years. So yeah, I ask for help and I know it’s a lot of pressure but telling me all the things I do wrong when I’m calling for your help does kinda make you another reason that I don’t want to live. No it is not your fault. But you should have just left me alone. But being a guilty asshole doesn’t fix me or make my panic attacks any less severe. I’ve been going to doctors because you asked me and taking medications because you said they made me better. I thought you wouldn’t feel pressured or guilty if you knew I was trying to fix things. I’ve run out of reasons not to do it. I was holding out for my mom but now she is gone. And now I’m just the kid who cried wolf because you don’t believe me when I tell you how much I want to die. You laugh and call me a worthless bitch and tell me to do it because you’re tired of hearing me saying it over and over and over. Well I am tied of saying it over and over and over. 

To everyone else,
This is what I want. Don’t you dare pitty me.
Maybe a small bit of me wants to do it to prove a point. That if you have enough people telling you all the things you will never be and all the things you ruin then yes, they will eventually snap and that will be the end of it. No more sorrys or just keep trying or things will get better. Just fucking silence. And not the aching emptiness I feel right now because that is still something. But actual emptiness. I want to cease to exist and melt into the emptiness. I know its right because when I think of it it’s the only time I feel okay.  I’m a mix of all the wrong things and I cant fix it. So the only sorry I’ll allow is that I’m sorry I cant live up to everyone’s expectations even my own and so I choose not to live.

3805,"Bored and apathetic. I really don't know where to start here. I'm 17 years old (18 in 2 weeks) and just moved in to college. I've been really depressed for many years. I've never been very social, never had anyone I was really close to for very long. My parents are divorced, I'm not very close to either of them. Mom and I always fight, Dad cheated on her and beat me and my brother (only a few times tho). I'm also gay. 

 I've never had any vision of what I wanted my life to be outside of high school, and I still don't. I don't care about studying or what my major is. To me, life is inherently pointless. You're born, you live, you die. Whatever career you pick doesn't matter, and whatever joy you derive from those you surround yourself with is fleeting. It's like I want to meet and interact with other people but I realize whenever I try that it really doesn't matter. I have nothing of interest to say and I don't really care what anyone else has to say. 

I've just been so bored and apathetic for a long time. I can remember lying in bed when I was like 8 thinking how much better my parent's lives would be if I had never existed. 

I've been thinking of suicide for a long time, but have never gathered the courage to go through with anything because knowing me, I'd probably fuck up any suicide attempt I'd ever make. I know everyone here is just gonna give me the usual ""you have so much to live for,"" ""it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" shit. I've heard all that before and it doesn't mean anything to me. I don't value money, success, material goods, or companionship so the rewards of this world mean nothing to me, and the whole appeal of suicide is its permanence. Saying that killing yourself is something that can't be undone is like telling a sex addict that girls have tits. Kind of counterproductive to what you were going for, I think.

I was in college for a year, dropped out to take an amazing job halfway across the country, and then was justifiably let go after only three months due to being generally incompetent at my unbelievably simple retail-oriented. It took me nearly half a year to find another job, only to be let go once more after just one month for what I can only assume was general incompetence (""you're just not the right fit for our company"" was the most detail they gave, and I felt I was doing a great job until then). I was hired at a place that gives very sporadic work not long after, and am only making enough money to pay for food/bus fare while my increasingly fed-up father has been paying my rent and bills. I keep searching for work, albeit without much heart, because my problem is that things just feel utterly hopeless on a cold, impossible-to-ignore logical level. I feel stupid and incapable of pulling off even the most basic of adult functions, which leads to depression, which leads to me moping around and not doing anything, which leads to proving the point (and angry room mates screaming about the messes I don't clean up), and on and on and on and on. Suicide, in my convoluted logic, isn't so much a one-way ticket to a pain-free state of being as it is a logical step to remove myself as a burden to everyone around me.

I asked if she really was 18 and she said yes and then I asked if we could have coffee together and get to know one another before discussing anything of that nature.

13010,"My teenage years feel cut short because of 2020 and I wish so much time hadn't been wasted *Just a quick warning, I'm just piling out my thoughts and they are depressing to say the least. There might be someone who relates to parts of this, maybe not.* 

Like everyone else, I had plans for this year. I was going to start living my life to the fullest, and things had been going really well in my personal life so it seemed like that was possible. I was almost out of my depressive episode, I had a solid group of friends for the first time in years, and was having successful encounters with my crushes.

Needless to say, the year did not turn out to be what I'd hoped. I became depressed again, fell into old bad habits and made new ones. For weeks - maybe even months - I stayed curled up on the floor in my room staring blankly at my phone or the carpet. Any significant object from pre-quarantine (like a playbill or a dress) became a relic to be worshipped. I didn't/couldn't leave the house for months, and even now I've only been outside around seven times. 

I can't even tell if I've snapped, but my own thoughts scare me now. All my fears worsened. When something good happens, I break down because I know it will be taken away by the misfortune that sits on my shoulders. Some days I don't feel anything, and other days my emotions are on thin ice. 

The worst thing about all this is that I'll never be able to get this time back. I can live a good adult life and live it up, but they won't be able to replace laughing with friends at the beach. Going to the back of the school by the dumpsters to listen to trashy music. Making stupid decisions. Having the largest of your problems being you hiding the F from family you got while you try to fix it. Things that aren't the same when you are an adult, or a child.

I'm good looking, funny, confident, great hair, great voice, i have women, i have money, but I'm not happy. My entire personality feels empty, I just emulate whatever character I've seen before, for whatever suits the situation. I don't really feel like a person. When i'm not trying to emulate anyone, all I really am is just angry, edgy, unfunny, blunt, and above all just stubborn. My refusal to change as I grew up is ultimately why I am suffering, my suffering has always been my own fault.

I realised that my attitudes towards women and my outlook on life stems from my deep hatred of my mother, growing up and even now I wanted nothing more for her to die and suffer. I wish I had talked about this to someone earlier. Maybe I would have been able to become someone more functional. I suppose the feeling of betrayal from the person I loved most will never leave me, it will always hurt, and I just can't seem to forget.

2576,"Anyone else realize how messed up Timmy Turner’s life was? Looking back, this is quite possibly the saddest show I’ve ever watched. 

His parents were either gone, or not liking him. I.e. their distrust in him when he says Vicky is rude to him. They also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him. His only teacher quite literally was insane. Not only that, this teacher had a profound disliking for Timmy. He’s also bullied in school, both by his “friends” and the person the show actually identifies as a bully. Lastly, the person who does take care of him most of the time, Vicky, is quite possibly a psychopath. 

It gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies. These fairies can solve every problem Timmy has, it’s everything Timmy has ever *dreamed* of. Sometimes things get so bad, they take him to another world (that fairy world thing) They quite literally blind him from his dark reality, as they bring him to another dimension, make him a superhero, get rid of his bullies, give him a girlfriend, all the things he could *imagine* they brought to him. 

Did you ever think that maybe the reason he can’t show Cosmo and Wanda to other people, isn’t because they would be taken away, but because they don’t exist? Think about it, his parents, his teacher, everyone constantly gives him weird looks, treats him like he’s lost it, treats him like he’s a “not all there” 5 year old. Maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much, isn’t because he just doesn’t like them, but because the “fairies” Timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he doesn’t try in school. 

Toward the end of the show, his parents get him a dog. Now, if you’re the parent to a 13 year old you’re not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own. You’d only get them a dog if the child ABSOLUTELY needs it. In Timmy’s case, the dog is likely just a therapy dog, who the parents got for Timmy thinking it could help him return to reality.

4804,"I'm not okay.I've lived with depression pretty much my whole life, and in the past 8 or so years anxiety has been a problem for me too. Before I left the house for work this morning I was already feel both pretty bad.

I ended up putting on my fake practiced customer service face and made it through the work day. Then I got home and it got worse. I went to pay a couple bills, and the first thing I see before paying any bills is that my credit card is over drawn by a couple hundred dollars. Between having to make a payment on my card, and the bill I was actually going to pay, I'm completely out of money. I just got paid, I don't get paid for two weeks, and I will be out of town for a work trip on pay day without direct deposit, so I'm completely broke, have bills that are due before my next pay check, and my next pay check will get to me late.

My credit card has been a blessing and a curse for me. The only reason I'm under a mountain of credit card debt is because I was in a bad place and needed to use it or not have a place to live or food. I'm glad I had it when I needed it, but it's so impossible to get out from under. 

I don't know how I'm going to survive the next two weeks. I'm at the lowest point I've been at in a very long time. I know everyone has money issues, and no one wants to hear about mine. I can only take so much for so long. I've been under crippling debt for over a decade now. Every time I start to get under it something else comes up. I'll start getting my bills down a bit then my car dies. Oh, there goes another couple thousand. A family member dies, and I get some inheritance, I can make a huge payment towards getting out of debt. Oh, my car dies again. All of that money I got goes to buying a replacement.

8501,"Help meFor me, depression is something that seems to have been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was ten, and have never been the same since. At first, my depression and sadness mostly came from grief, which is almost totally natural for someone of that age. Then, I turned it all against myself. I started blaming myself, not necessarily for my mother's death, but for anything and everything that went wrong. My first thoughts of suicide came when I was just eleven, and they have been coming and going ever since. I've been through acute in-patient services three times, and residential treatment facilities twice. I seem to get better every time, but it all spirals down after a while. I've probably been on more than 6 antidepressants. None of them have had a lasting impact on me.

When I was around 15 or 16, I started to gain a romantic interest in other males. I've tried to impress a lot of guys over the years, but none of those attempts have worked out. What's more, I eventually began blaming myself for just being gay too. I started calling myself a ""fucking faggot,"" among other things. In fact, I say horrible things about myself whenever I do something wrong. They can vary from ""you're a horrible person,"" to ""nobody loves or cares about you.""

I don't have a lot of friends, and the ones I do have never seem to talk to me unless I come to them first, which I hate having to constantly do. It makes me think that they don't care about me. I usually end up not talking to my friends for months on end to see if they'd actually get worried, which of course they never do. I realize that's not the best way of handling things, but I constantly have to tell my friends that I hate having to come to them first every single time. They never seem to listen to that, though.

I'm sorry that this post is such a discombobulated mess, but I really haven't been feeling the best today. I essentially skipped work and stayed in bed all day because I just felt so horrible.

10378,"I don't remember a time when I didn't wish to be deadI am 16. I have an undiagnosed chronic intestinal issue (visible damage when I was scoped, unknown cause). I have a tendency towards very bad anxiety and I can't stand being in public when I feel like I'm going to throw up. Because of this, I miss a lot of school. When you miss a lot of school, you're required to get a doctor's note excusing you for every day that you're gone. My family has no money, and the many hospital visits made my relationship with my parents completely despondent. Also, my main doctor decided that my anxiety was the cause of my propensity for ulcers (something that studies do not support) and prescribed me Prozac. I told him that I was opposed to taking something that would alter the way that I think/feel. He decided that he didn't like that, so he described me as a belligerent, faking patient and now, no doctor in my county will see me. 

So now, I can't get a doctor's excuse, so I'm listed as unexcused, so I can't make up missed work, so I'm doing badly in classes, so my parents see me as their failure and don't wish to talk to me. My friends guilt me for being gone so often and started distancing themselves.


On an entirely separate note, my girlfriend of two years told me a few months ago that she hasn't felt that she loved me for the last year or so of saying it.

So here I am, holding onto the one thing that used to make me happy and waiting for the inevitable moment when she scrapes me off and I'm entirely alone. The only reasons that I haven't ended my life are my two brothers. One of them is 20 and the other is 5. I know that, in both of their cases, I don't want to imagine the pain that it would cause for them.

12795,"It's All Beginning To Be Too Much...Depression is fucking *harsh*. I'm convinced it's the most vile and disgusting thing in this world.

It's making me fail my classes because I can't concentrate on my homework and I just *can't* do anything. I get distracted by things too easily, and just can't focus. I get carried away by my own thoughts. *And not to mention* that I can't remember shit. It's only getting worse, too, as I fall deeper into depression; a few months ago, I just forgot what homework I had or what I left in my room, *now?* Now, I can't even remember what day it is. I can't remember what day or time it is and what responsibilities I should be doing. I can't remember anything, not even to shower or eat.

Depression has made me tired and I'm starving but at the same time I'm just not hungry at all. I can't sleep because I'll sit there for *hours* but my head won't shut up, and when I finally do fall asleep, I keep waking up at random times in the middle of the night. And if I don't do that, then my dream conscience is a *bitch*. When dreaming, minding my own business, a thundering voice says, ""don't take your medication, it's disgusting poison"", ""don't try to get in shape, you'll fail anyways"", ""don't trust her, she's a liar"".

I hate this. I'm scared of death, and yet there's that stupid little voice in my head saying ""just kill yourself"". I hate depression. I hate this. I don't want to kill myself but I can't stop thinking about it because my conscience thinks it's a damn good idea.

This is *exhausting*. I might knock myself out cold to avoid this pestering voice telling me to just off myself.

811,"19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've  tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine.

6744,"Day 2 of my learning thingy Tl;Dr my progress bar basically didn't move at all

Layman terms: did some research, hit a dead end. Am retracing my steps but I lost a lot of time. 

Today I was just browsing through YouTube a little more to see if there are already tetris ai that I could use. My target is tetr.io so I was seeing if there's any ai for that website.

So I found this tetris ai guide that apparently the comments are bashing the video for plagiarising the code and that the guy teaching sucks at explaining. I might still try it out tho. I found another guy with a tetris ai as well, might do that too. 

Then I found another video about cold clear. It's wayy too complicated for me. I tried using their discord and asking how does one operate this ai and oh boy let me list them, maybe. 

1. The AI was coded in rust(a programming language) . I have intellij and visual studio code as the interpreter(basically something to let me look at the code of this ai) and boy do rust hate visual code on windows. Idk how to put rust into intellij, haven't tried it. Also I'm not learning another programming language screw that. 

2. To use this thing is hard. I'm gonna have to search through thousands of lines of code and reverse engineer it so that I can figure out what the hell does each folder of scripts do. Oh boy I am too inexperienced for that.

3. I'm not even that advanced. I asked and one of the discord member told me how to run the AI using python. I mean I could also just download another app in that discord and run it but apparently if I wanna use python, I gotta use experience to know how to use the AI in a Web browser. There's no tutorial for this. Or at least not that I could think of.

10960,"My Dad is Depressed/Suicidal. Ready to die.I normally wouldn't ask for advice on this, but my heart is really hurting with this.. 

My dad has been depressed for a while now. Unhappy with where he is living. Unhappy with where he is in life and not being able to relax and having to be the sole provider of the house. (I currently have a job too and I help where I can, but I also have a buttload of bills and only make so much.) A few months back, he had left a job that had made him rather miserable; and pursued another job. Only to not get the job because of the insurance company learning that he was on pain medications and they didn't want to take the risk. He's been working in the same industry for years. No issues whatsoever. After this devastation and having to scramble to find a job to pay bills and make ends meet. He asked his doctor to take him off of his pain meds, they did.. and now he's in a lot of pain. The current job he has is really rough. So he's constantly having locked up shoulders and etc. (He broke his neck when I was younger, around 12. I'm 21 now.) 

Him and I've talked, he's expressed how he feels. It has made me scared for him, and how he is thinking. I can't fathom the idea of losing my dad. I know that life is inevitable and one day it will pass. I just feel like he's too young to be thinking about the end game, and that he has so much to live for. His newer wife, whom I cherish very much; has had two children with him. One being 6 and the other being 1 years old(along with an 8 year old from her previous marriage.)  Am I selfish for wanting him to be happy and to just keep on going? This is why I want to finish college.. I want to be able to pay all of his bills; and for him to be able to breath.

13618,"Next time you feel like Raging, remember this Hey, I am an 18 year old *Lebanese* gamer. The reason Im writing this is to show you a bit of my gaming experience as a gamer in Lebanon

Disregarding the super slow internet, we get power outages every 4-6 hours, which means you get disconnected from any match you're playing. So when my humble self decides to play a match of apex at 1 PM after studying, I am most probably gonna be in a match when the clock strikes 2 and the power goes out, erasing all memories of the shitty randoms and the 9 kills I got this game.

But it doesnt end there! Imagine yourself currently at the heat of the battle and are so close to down the whole squad single handedly while your random teammates spam the ""revive me"" button, then the power goes out because its now 6 PM.

OR worst of all, playing Ranked matches! Other than the unstable ping and packet loss like a woman on her period, imagine being so concentrated on the screen of your TV/monitor, calculating every move of the enemy team and doing complex probability calculations... when suddenly the clock strikes 12 AM and its time for your hourly dose of power outage. 

You stand still in pitch black darkness, in eerie silence. As you hear your father snore from the other room (from shisha/arguile naturaly), you slowly comprehend that all youve done is lost, and youre probably gonna get a penalty for abandoning the match.

""But I play story driven, singleplayer games"" you might say...well you didnt save for the past 20 minutes and autosave didnt manage as well, enough said. You might also say ""ill just log back in and resume my game I guess"", until you realise you that the save file is corrupt now because of the suddenly power cut, and you've gotta repeat everything from the past 2 hours. 

And no, the majority of us lebanese gamers cant gEt a uPs bRo, mainly because of inflation (a 30$ item which costed 45,000 LL now costs 255,000 LL)

This is a sneak peak of my spare time after rigorous hours of Anatomy, Genetics and what not.

377,"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

---
I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

If the text seems off it's my fault as my English is not so great as I think.

I hope to live with the pain as long as I can be useful, but working is difficult and I am afraid I cannot complete another year like last.  I have lived with this condition for 5 years now.  It only gets worse.

If I do decide it is too hard, I would really like my family to understand that I am not angry or depressed.  It will take them a while to get over their emotions so the message should be delayed.  I want to guarantee they receive the message without letting anyone else know about it.

I will probably need to have redundant servers send a video on a scheduled date to several friends and family.

I understand it may be hurtful to receive such a message, so I will want to make clear that I will not contact them again and it is okay to let go.  I have money I can leave, so they might be less angry with me.

I am married, and I worry about her most of all.  We have always been friends, but I do not believe she loves me.  Until I became sick, I was her security.  I was strong, smart, and quite successful for my age.  I've held on until she finished school and built a career.  Now, I think she will be okay.

I want her to find someone she loves so she can raise children as she always wanted.  She cares about me of course, but I can tell it hurts her to give up her plans and support someone while she is still so young.  She would do it.  She would stay with me forever if I never left, completely loyal but not in love.  She'd give up on romance and sex and family and children... she can even have a real wedding this time.

I live with my narc dad and I hate him. Life here is unbearable for many reasons. 

Was bullied throughout growing up which led me to be mentally ill. (Social Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder) 

As such I'm too mentally ill to get a job to try and save up and move out because no one will be willing to hire a train wreck like me plus I have 0 experience. 

Too mentally ill to go to uni and study and even if I did I'd still end up at this hellish place every summer.

I have no friends and no relationship experience thanks to my mental illnesses and spend 100% of my time alone. Even when I had friends they saw me as a burden and never wanted to go out anywhere with me. 

Because of my age and the fact I'm not in education the chance of me realistically making friends are slim to none so I get to enjoy a life filled with loneliness.

I hate my body and my face (want/need surgery that I can't afford for above reasons) and think I'm too ugly to be seen in strong lighting so I never go out during the day. I only go out late into the night. Can't remember the last time I went outside when the sun was shining. Pretty sure I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. 

No matter what time I go to bed I always fall asleep at 5am due to stress and anxiety. When I manage to get up I realise that I have no reason to get out of bed so I'll just stay there all day despite having 5 alarms to keep me from sleeping. 

I'm burnt out, fed up and tired and most importantly **I don't want to try anymore**, so I'm just waiting for something to push me over the edge at this point.

4104,"Thoughts. No direction.I don’t know how I’d do it. I tried to once with pills but I was so naive, I didn’t know how much was a lethal dose and took too little. Four and half days in the looney bin. Wasn’t a bad experience. Actually I learned how to be pretty happy while I was there. Only lasted a few months once I got out. I had been resisting doing it because of how bad it would hurt those I care about, but, as selfish as it is, even that wasn’t enough to hold me back anymore. I’m still sorry tho. Now, I’ve only kept myself from doing it because I feel like I can’t leave without giving something to the world first. Something people can find comfort in and use as motivation to get their own help. It seems hypocritical, yet still correct. Maybe not correct. I don’t know for sure. I don’t know anything for sure. I can’t tell when I love someone anymore. I can’t even tell if all of this stuff is legitimate. Most of the time it feels like I should shut up and get over it. The people I care about need help still, and I don’t know anyone who’ll be there for them other than me. But, slowly, they’re growing and learning. They’re becoming so independent and learning to help themselves. I thought I’d be jealous but I’m just so happy that I get to see it. The more happy about it I get, tho, the worse I feel for wanting to leave. I’ll be abandoning them. Makes me think about this “masterpiece” I wanted to make to help others. Maybe it’s not really about that. Maybe I just want to make that so I can feel like I’ve compensated for the pain I’ll be bringing those I love. Either way, I know I can’t go on. I don’t mean to be vague, but I’ve fucked everything up. If any of you care enough to know more I’ll discuss things, but this is already running long. I don’t say that to pull the whole “no one cares about me” card, I just wouldn’t really expect you to care. No ones responsibility but mine.

A little over a years worth of our relationship was you cheating many many times and disrespecting me many times. You made a huge promise to want to work things out so I figured why not. We are 18 year old parents, so naturally things are hard. 
Maybe it's the postpartum depression that I have and I'm not aware of. I don't know.
I'm sorry that now when I get angry at you I lash out and hit you violently. You may not believe me but I try to hard to hold myself back because I don't want to cause you pain but every time you fuck up its like a slap in the face after everything we have been through.
Last night we both verbally and physically abused each other. I tried not to put my hands on you but you were being so mean.. And I know that sounds childish but it's true.
I was having some kind of breakdown and all I wanted was genuine comfort from you but you were being a jackass to me. You even told me to my face that being nice to me didn't work so now you were going to be an asshole.
When I was crying you were mocking me and making fun of me. You kept saying how you didn't care about me anymore and that I was a waste of your time. 
Last night you punched me in the leg twice, stepped on my get countless times, shook me by the shoulders countless times, head budded me countless times, and pushed me into the fridge where I was hurt lying on the floor and you turned off the kitchen light and left me there. I know you say you did it because I threw your clothes outside so then it is my fault. Everything is my fault. And there's no point in being alive anymore. I've nerve felt so alone in my life.

10907,"Been going through a really hard time lately, just need to vent.I've struggled with alcoholism, depression, and poverty quite a bit in the past and now quite a bit in the present. At a certain point, I was blacking out on friends and acquaintance's couches from place to place, and for a while, I was basically homeless and basically wandering aimlessly. 

I stopped counting the exact days I've been sober a while ago, but it's been over 2 years. I've had trouble finding AA meetings in my area, and this is the closest area I've found on Reddit that applies to my problems and has people who've dealt with similar things that I've dealt with. 

I mostly became sober out of pure necessity, and even that was really hard. A big motivator for me is that I used to be a member of a very radical cult that I was recruited into when I was at the bottom of my luck. I saw horrible things there, I was treated horribly but other people managed to get treated much worse. I managed to escape, but it wasn't at all easy after that. 

For a time, I got a job, and an apartment but even that is gone now and the apartment likely won't be for long. I was a welder, but recently I was laid off due to cuts they had to make. The only reason I even have utilities is because my landlord has been very understanding, really has tolerated the above and beyond and I am very grateful towards him. 

Right now, I don't really even have any food, quite literally no food, and no money for food at that. I feel incredibly weak and numb, mostly I've drunk water. I was hungry for quite a bit the last time I was this low, but at least I had liquor which was better than nothing. 

I don't really have any friends, I lost quite a few friends

I don't feel suicidal as much as I do feel tired, hungry, and I haven't had the urge to drink this badly in months. At least then maybe I'd have a distraction. This was mostly just to vent, but I'd like someone to talk to as well.

I can't feel joy anymore, I barely leave my room, I can't hold a conversation.  I'm thankful for meeting a few great people in my life, and I've always, always loved them no matter what. Hopefully they'll remember that. I'm sad to be leaving them behind but its too late for me now and they might understand given time. Tonight I'm going to read my favourite book, put on my favourite album and drift off forever. Whoever you are, I sincerely hope you have a great life and I wish you the best, but I have come to terms with my decision and I'm no longer scared. I'm going to look at the stars one last time out of my window. I'm going to close my eyes and sleep forever. 

*Edit: I'm still here and open to speak to anyone but it is nearly time. I'm listening to Nujabes. I just finished reading Beowulf. I'm just waiting for the stars to become a little clearer. Its been amazing to have some human interaction in the last hours. I care about each and every one of you and hope your journey takes you to new and exciting places, even after I'm long gone and forgotten. If somehow I'm still going tomorrow, I'll let you know!

11520,"Wow mom thanks for my life, i hate it(Keep in mind I'm pretty sarcastic) also summary at the end

For context: Earlier I didn't want to eat, so my mom asked what I ate and I didn't want her to get mad and send me to my room, so I said a ham sandwich. She checked the fridge and saw the ham was in the bottom of the fridge-drawer (its like a drawer in the fridge and it's clear)

Anyways like any rational and kind parent, she said to me ""You disgust me, You're a despicable person to me! After everything I did for you this is how you repay me?""

And all I can think is ""No shit! You gave me the ability to live a crappy life and hate myself thanks soooo much! I'm also just EXTREMELY grateful that I get to be yelled at and starved in my room while you do less than the minimum to get by for me""

And while I'm thinking about that, I guess she can read my mind or something because she starts rambling about how I'm ""lucky"" to be alive! so whoopty do I'm so happy I get to suffer!!!

Anyways she goes on about how much of a disappointment I am, but what did she expect from a kid born from a narcisistic asshole??!

For some reason this was the really nice and kind conversation that just clicked for me. About how stupid and meaningless my life is!! It's just as meaningful as Logan pauls banger appology

Ik it's bound to happen at one point but when it does my suicide note with my mom's part on it is going to say ""I guess I just can't comprehend such nice words about how I'm a screw up!"" Cuz I know she won't care any more if I say how shes the problem

Also if you want to why life sucks go read my other posts cuz I'm too lazy to write it down here!

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said ""the higher you climb, the harder you fall"", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already. I have to admit that ever since i lost my job, the suicidal thought have just kept haunting me and today after what happened, i feel that tomorrow would be the last day for me.

14661,"The second top most post of all time in this sub sums up my feelings at the minute perfectly - A goodbye.Nobody cares about your depression. Nobody. Until you make the ultimate decision and suddenly everyone makes a big fuss about how ""loved"" you were and how much they're all going to miss you. 

If you cared so much then where were you when I was crying my eyes out at 2am and just needed to vent? Where were you when I was drowning inside my own head and all I needed was a hand to ground me, tell me that I AM appreciated. That I'm NOT worthless. 

I'm nothing but a burden you would rather ignore. Until it's too late to ignore me, so you put on your mask of concern to keep up appearances. It's the way of the world. It's sad, but it's true. 

Rant part over.

I feel calmer now that I've decided to do it. That's strange isn't it? Years of trying to get healthy and be... Normal I suppose, have done little to help, but finally deciding to just do it has brought me peace. Given me a twisted sort of purpose. It's funny looking at it like that. I've bought my supplies and they're on the way. I'm going to spend this week writing letters to people. I'm only sorry about a few of them really. My brother and his kids mostly. He'll read this, because I'm going to give him all of my stuff anyway, so I want reiterate that I don't blame you bruv, you had enough going on. But I think you'll be better without me. I've done enough damage already. I'll write to the kids too, but I trust you to know which parts to tell them and which parts to keep to yourself. Don't tell anyone I pissed myself! ^^Haha

It's too much. Living like this isn't living, it's a sad struggle that seems to have no end. I can't do it any more.

543,"I'm a disgusting piece of shit and here is my rant.I'm so fucking done. I recently moved to the other side of the country for my internship, better said: to work fulltime without even getting paid. I have literally nobody here; all my coworkers are at least ten years older (seriously), I can't join any sportsclub or other activities around here cause I'm not an official student so I'm not welcome there. All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much. I never felt wanted in my entire life, and even he, after all this time, won't spend time with me. He's probably gonna break up with me soon cause I'm a depressed, hidious piece of shit with no friends who's always yelling and ruining everything. 

Things were finally getting better for me; I quit drugs after using almost half of my life, I started to eat better and to exercise, but nothing helps. I'm still the same disgusting whore, and I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm probably just gonna go to that stupid party, eventhough it's two and a half hours by train and I've been vomiting my brains out for the past 24hrs.

I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 

Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.

 Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death.

4740,"Professor berated me in front of class, and it's possible I could fail, please help calm me downBackground: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 14.  I'm 20 now, and I've been pretty much ok for the past year, but things get bad when I'm stressed or when situations like this occur.

Yesterday was the final exam for one of my easy introductory college classes. I woke up late and had to rush to make it to class on time. I realized I forgot my wallet so I didn't have any ID, but this professor has never required ID for any test before so I figured it was ok. I only have a pencil and my cell phone with me. Well, it wasn't ok and she required ID for the final. I handed in my test and explained to her that I forgot my wallet and I'm very sorry but I don't have any ID. She was pissed and said ""why would you do, how stupid are you?"" and continued to yell at me saying ""you always need to show ID for finals, haven't you ever been to school before?"". This went on for 5 minutes with her yelling and sighing and saying there was nothing she could do, before she told me it was ok and let me hand in the test.

To make matters worse, I missed one of the tests for this class (do to an anxiety attack). The final grade takes into account only 3 of the 4 tests taken in the semester. I thought it would be ok if I only took 3 tests but now I'm not so sure. This was pretty stupid on my part, but if it's not ok and she counts the zero I'm pretty much screwed because I can't go to talk to her after yesterday.

I don't know how to deal with this. I've always been a top student, I have a 94 average in this class and a 3.8 GPA. I have never been yelled at like that before and it has me really shaken up.

Ever since I was found out to be 'gifted,' that's what was pushed on me all throughout junior high, high school, and university. But instead of being my family's golden child, I'm left as a bitter disappointment as I've spent all of 2019 essentially in bed thanks to my unmanageable social anxiety that prevents me from operating as a normal person, something my family never bothered to address and they hoped I would 'grow' out of it. Well instead of growing out of it, it turned into a deeply rooted personality disorder that I struggle everyday with just to not kill myself. Don't get me wrong, my university had a counseling center and psychiatric services that I tried to make use of. I went through several different counselors, psychiatrists, and medications that I can't even remember the names of, but nothing helps when it's that far buried in you.

How well you do in University does not show how well you'll do in real life. I only ever did the minimum - study and homework. I didn't have friends. I didn't do extracurriculars, internships, or research. Any free time I had I spent laying in bed watching something on my phone. I haven't even sent out a single resume at all since graduating because all I have on it is that I went to college, and that I know that I'm too nonfunctional to even be an engineer, let alone getting past a fucking interview. I'm probably going to have to settle for something like working at the local dollar store because that's all I can see myself realistically doing and hopefully not fucking it up. Each day, that degree loses value to employers and it's probably going to be worthless. Some golden child I am.

8515,"Some thoughtsI'll delete this post. I spent today deleting my social media. In some cases going post by post. I've always hated social media. I joined it begrudgingly...... All except for Myspace. I was one of the first couple hundred folks to join that. There's my claim to fame. Fucking sad.

Does anyone here think, or wonder if we care too much about what other people think? My friends would tell me no. They're always like you're the dude who doesn't give a fuck, but that's not really true. It took me a long fucking time to delete my social media, and I wouldn't consider myself very active. But there were tens of thousands of posts of every variety. It was disgusting to read, well, pretty much all of it. Including the shit on reddit. Then I considered how much wasted time, energy, and life went into creating well-thought out responses to complete strangers. Goddamn. That energy could have gone somewhere more useful.  


Sometimes I wonder if I'm trying to rid myself of excuses for suicide. I've never had much money, but once upon a very recent time I came into a lot of it. Essentially, I gave it away. After that I quit what was once my dream job.  It seems as though I'm trying to fuck up my health, which I've preserved incredibly well over the years....... Today I shaved my head, which I'll regret if I live long, because I look like a fucking neo-nazi when I'm bald.

I don't want to die. I don't think. I have a fantastic life to the eye that doesn't know any better. People really fucking look up to me for some goddamn reason. I know I could do the world a lot of good if I could just bottle up and sell these good intentions.

Anyway, I've been going through this shit for decades, and at this point I won't even leave a handsome corpse. My heart dies for all the people going through what I can only imagine is similar shit to my own. 

Goddamn, folks. I hope tomorrow you all wake up with a clarity of purpose, and the boundless energy of a toddler on Mountain Dew.

She was a friend and we would walk home together a short distance. Then one day I started getting turned on by the idea of touching her so a few times I would touch hand and arm very subtly. She didn't seem to react at all. Then I took it to the next level as started touching her waist. This clearly made her feel uncomfortable and would kind of push my hand off, but she never said anything and I continued to do it for a few walks. I remember touching her waist, I don't know if I ever touched her butt, I really hope I didn't. Eventually she told me to stop and I just stopped. I am in my late 20s now.

13590,"Hope &amp; perspective neededThere are no words to describe the pain I feel tonight. The last couple weeks have been a complete nosedive, and I don't know why. If I contact my psychiatrist about potentially increasing my mood stabilizer, she will tell me that I need to get back in therapy, and right now there are complicated reasons why I ""can't"" (please don't tell me to get therapy; that is not what this is about right now).

I guess I need to hear from someone other than myself or the people involved in the situations that are causing me so much pain and stress, that it will be okay. That although something may feel like the end of the world right now, and suicide may feel like the answer, there is potential for happiness. I can't even begin to get into the situation at hand, but it is the definition of being stuck between a rock and a hard place.

One component of it comes down to the fact that I am making one person my entire world, and I am willing to hurt myself and kill myself over them. There is nothing they can do differently or have done wrong--they have at times begged me to leave because they know what this is doing to me--and we are both victims of shitty circumstances that I struggle to accept. I have no faith that anything will turn out well and my recent depression has made me all the more pessimistic, hopeless, angry, resentful, and fucking sad.

I know that life is worth/about more than that. I know that happiness comes in many forms and not always how we envision it. I guess I just need perspective. I feel so strongly that I am going to end my life, but I know it isn't that. I just want to end *this* life and end my suffering. Any perspective--please, not the ""it's *just* a relationship"" type--about the nature of life and happiness and hope in general would be much appreciated. Why should I have hope?

I already did a bit of thinking on it and decided time travel is likely a possibility. My theories vary.

# Theory 1 +LI Explanation: The Chosen

I (and others with dreams like mine) either discovered or experienced time travel. As a direct and unavoidable consequence, traveling through time causes a ""break"" that results in what I call ""Linear Inconsistency"" or LI. LI (in my experience) only seems to affect dreams, but may be the reason why I feel pain for seemingly no reason. It either only affects dreams, or it can also affect my nerve endings.

# Theory 1a: Crude Travel

In the future, time travel is created and I (as well as others) travel through time. Same effects as theory 1, but instead of being ""chosen"", LI is a rare side-effect of Time Travel.

In another universe, I found a way to travel through time. Instead of sending ""me"" back through time in my own universe, it sent me here, which caused the me that originates here to have LI.

# Theory 3: God?

Should God exist, it is (for whatever reason) directly causing my LI. The only question is: Why?

# Theory 4: 2012/Mandella Effect

2012 is recognized by some people to be a point when our Universe collided with another (or something along those lines). This event is suspected to be the source of the Mandella effect. Perhaps this event also cause my LI.

# Theory 5: Condition Without Cause

LI is not influenced by anything, and is instead just one of the quirks of this universe. Linearity can simply have errors, and I have a likelihood of such errors occuring.

All these theories could technically explain it. Either way, it seems as the only real way to tell would be to continue living and pursue an understanding of Time (and perhaps time travel).",non-suicide,"temporally non linear dreams a k a time fuckery i have dreams about things that happen in the future basically it goes  i have a dream   gt i forget it   gt the event i was shown in the dream eventually and inevitably happens   gt i become anywhere from somewhat to confused to majorly disoriented due to a feeling far stronger and much different than deja vu   gt the intensity of the disorientation contributes to how memorable the even was   gt repeat i already did a bit of thinking on it and decided time travel is likely a possibility my theories vary   theory 1 li explanation the chosen i and others with dreams like mine either discovered or experienced time travel as a direct and unavoidable consequence, traveling through time causes a break that results in what i call linear inconsistency or li li in my experience only seems to affect dreams, but may be the reason why i feel pain for seemingly no reason it either only affects dreams, or it can also affect my nerve endings   theory 1a crude travel in the future, time travel is created and i as well as others travel through time same effects as theory 1, but instead of being chosen , li is a rare side effect of time travel   theory 2 strings attached in another universe, i found a way to travel through time instead of sending me back through time in my own universe, it sent me here, which caused the me that originates here to have li   theory 3 god? should god exist, it is for whatever reason directly causing my li the only question is why?  theory 4 2012/mandella effect 2012 is recognized by some people to be a point when our universe collided with another or something along those lines  this event is suspected to be the source of the mandella effect perhaps this event also cause my li   theory 5 condition without cause li is not influenced by anything, and is instead just one of the quirks of this universe linearity can simply have errors, and i have a likelihood of such errors occuring  all these theories could technically explain it either way, it seems as the only real way to tell would be to continue living and pursue an understanding of time and perhaps time travel ",390
576,"She left again. Tonight's the night I'm done.
I'm killing myself tonight because I have literally no reason to be here anymore. I'm fed up with everything, the girl I've known for two years has been a blessing, she's been a crutch for me when I've needed it, she's helped me through everything and I've helped her. 
I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this. It's not your fault, you've been the reason I've made it to this age. I would've given up before if it weren't for you. I hope you can find happiness, I know I did.

After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it.

She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here.

3477,"Constant suicidal ideationSo this isn't a new problem, I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep, sat at work ( like now ) I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, the same thoughts are there all day every day, driving to work or coming home, seeing my 'friends', doing fun stuff, etc.

It's just constant and never ending. I don't really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like I'm in mental pain all the bloody time.

A couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist, after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that it's unlikely to respond to medication (of which I've tried a lot).

This has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life. I lost the woman I love, the one person who somewhat soothed the pain, because I couldn't commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know I'm only going to kill myself. I really wanted to be with her, marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything else.

Despite all this I'm fairly successful in business, I'm what most people consider very well off, but really this just hides whats going on under the surface.

I do occasionally talk to people about how I'm feeling, but almost nobody actually understands what I'm saying because they've never felt what I feel. I can't really talk to my best friend/ex now because she's moved on to somebody new, he's a nice guy I think and I'm glad that she's with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long run.

6985,"I am a burden to you all.I've tried posting in these kinds of forums before, and I barely, if ever, get advice or friendly words. Usually my posts are ignored or mocked. I can't live with being ignored any longer. 

First of all, I have a lot of issues and I can't go to a therapist about them. Why? Because I'm a fucking coward, that's why. I was on a list for about a year regarding my anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Guess what? The fucking loser that is me, as soon as he got somebody willing to help him, fucking cancelled it. You know why? Because the therapists issued to me all worked normal work hours, and if I wanted to see her, I would have to tell my employer the real reason why I needed to take time off. I realized I'd literally rather end my life than tell people at my work what was up with me, and that fact persists today.

I'm not going to say it isn't my fault, because it is. I am a kissless virgin because I've never even approached a girl, not even talked to one in the context of a friendship. I blame myself for my cowardice and my pathetic loser nature. I can never in a million years talk to a stranger to ask them out, even as friends, I'd rather die, which is what I plan on doing. Women in particular would be glad to see me go.

I have no friends, no hobbies (STOP telling me to ‘Find hobbies’, I guarantee you I’ve tried loads of hobbies before you say that to me, all of them feel like a chore). For now I lay down and occasionally play games or watch crap TV. I’m an adult and that’s literally what I do all day, other than work a crappy job which pays as much as a first day minimum wage worker (I have no real education).

Why should a loser like me, a lazy, unambitious, kissless, cowardly, retarded social reject live? I honestly have no reason of my own, if none of you can give me a reason, why should I not kill myself? I have zero good qualities, and have no ambition to change that.

11626,"""daddy issues""hi, they talk about girls with ""daddy issues"" like they're whores, and i'll admit that all of my relationships I participated in were an attempt to fill a hole in my heart

I suppose I should start at the beginning. my father was the one who spanked me when i was bad (i self-harm to this day). he was always the one who yelled at me when i did something wrong. when my mom couldn't get me to confess to something, my dad was brought in. him screaming at me usually could get something out of me, even if it was a lie. 

as i grew older, my father would usually interrupt me with ""why aren't you saying [insert me agreeing with him/being thankful/me apologizing]"" whenever i had the audacity to argue with him. this continues to this day.

one day, i yelled at my father back for the first time for the first year, instead of just breaking down into tears like i usually did. he threatened to spank me, despite me being 18

nothing i ever say is good enough, nothing i ever due is free from criticism, i always fuck up, im always in the wrong

i would outline all of the arguments ive had with him but if im honest with you they're all the same

1) i do something wrong
2) i try to defend what i did
3) get interrupted
4) dad goes on a rant about how i don't appreciate, don't apologize, how im bad, etc
5) this upsets me
6) dad apologizes for yelling, what he said, says im right
7) make up

then it repeats when i fuck something else up

hes told me im close-minded, stubborn, stupid, a host of bad things, but the worst is that he doesn't really listen to me

he'll just stop talking and turn away, because his lecture didn't get to me

i apologize for bad grammar, i kind of just wanted to put my feelings somewhere

im probably going to go to college counciling tomorrow too

-Recurring, repeating thoughts of ""i want to die"" and ""kill me"" over and over in my head for months. six months plus. I say these things out loud when I'm alone. google says that this isn't intrusive thoughts any more but suicidal ideation. I am working on a bank reconciliation and thinking I want to die. I am feeding my cat and wanting to die. i am out with friends and want to die. I am driving home from work and want to die. I am making a property repair and want to die. I am beating my fiance at videogames and wanting to die. Always in the back of my mind, kill me kill me kill me kill me.

-I had a plan. I moved house and now my plan wouldn't work. I've tried not to make a new plan.

-No one I've tried to talk to has understood. I think my grandma deliberately misheard when I said I was depressed, and said ""of course you're stressed"". The lady on the suicide line was really dismissive (""why would you want to live in a country that deported you?""). My fiance knows a little and is worried but I don't want to hurt him by telling him everything. Doctor just wants me in and out of her office as fast as possible. Trying to take my meds every day but they're not enough any more. If I told my mom I would just have to support *her* feeling bad about it.

-Sleeping about 4-6 hours a night. Working 40 hours a week at my day job. 20 hours or so at my business. 10 hours on political stuff. Phone with fiance 6-10 hours. More successful than any of my friends. Want to die the whole time.

-showering 3-4 times a week. brushing my teeth maybe every other day. mostly eating free bagels from work, microwave meals, pre packaged smoothies/protein shakes. self care is getting hard.

4565,"My friend is convinced suicide is the only solution.So my friend is still in her teens. She has been visiting a psychologist for theast year and they've talked about various schemas and issues. They've concluded most of her depression comes from her parents and her inability to live up to expectations. 

Before, it was just the pressure from her mum - saying stuff like, ""Why are you wearing that?"", ""Your skirt is too short."", ""You wouldn't have depression if youd just listen to me."", and just generally raising her voice and being as most typical Asian mothers are. I've seen her mother in action so its not just a biased comment from my friend. Her mother seems to be very demanded and having particular expectations about etiquette and academic performance. Her mother is also a very closed minded individual and doesn't like the fact that my friend discusses her thoughts and feelings with me.

And as of late, her father is siding with his wife, I'm assuming mostly due to the fact that he doesn't understand much about mental health and doesn't know what to do.

As a result, she feels like her parents are always against her and get upset that she can't live up to these set expectations to which she does try to meet. She has struggled with self harm before and has self esteem and self image issues. She has anxiety and depression and has shared she doesn't want to be around anymore, that she doesn't care, and that she feels lonely and empty.

I try to ask her questions about what she does want but even she doesn't know. She also feels even worse that she doesn't know and that she feels useless, and is convinced suicide is the only choice. She's still alive currently but I'm at a loss. While I can empathise with depression as I've gone through it myself, we're both fundamentally different people so what worked for me don't work for her.

I'm taking Engineering courses, which I pass and I excel in certain fields and all that, but I can't find happiness, or even a job, with what I have.
I was dumped by the love of my life because she fell in love with some asshat from another state she only knew online.
The girl I've been talking to recently just found a new boyfriend and probably didn't consider me an option.
I've said I want to die at least 5 days straight to friends and family, but they attribute it to my classes being stressful (which they aren't) and I can't bring myself to tell them how I feel in clarification.

I don't want to die. I don't believe in an afterlife so I know that this is the only shot at living- in any form- that I can, but at the same time I don't want to continue this inner torment.
I have pills, but I'm afraid I'll throw them up. Knife, but that leaves blood everywhere for the person that finds me. Rope, but no beam strong enough to hang by. The only option I have is get hit by a car/bus but that will bring my life's trouble on the poor person who happens to be behind the wheel.

Every moment I walk in the streets I hope hope hope hope hope hooope that a car rides the sidewalk and slams my head into a wall. I'm miserable. I'm desperate. Worse still, I'm lonely.

3465,"Peace of MindOk. Deep breath.

Victim of years of abuse. Years. I won't go into specifics because some folks are sensitive to that. From 10-16 or so.

Met a girl, settled down and got married. Things were ok for a while, I started to change according to my wife. So I told her everything. Everything. She handled it as well as could be expected and suggested therapy. Which I took. I felt no better but took it anyways.

Spent years in therapy, with no change. Found out through people that several of my numerous abusers were dead, I felt sad.

I was depressed all the time, no answer, no help. Turned away from suicide lines in Can/US because they don't help straight white men, programs for lgbt, poc and youth, but not adult men. Not here to gripe, just matter of fact.

On a work trip, I had to pull over at a rest stop to make use of the facilities, and there was another man in there, pleasuring himself. I watched for a while before getting involved (stupidly) When it was over, it felt like a weight had lifted off of me. My depression cleared.

My wife noticed the change when I got home too. I didn't tell her why. We made love for the first time in over 6 months. I never lost attraction for her just function.

Cut to two weeks later, the depression is back. And with a vengeance. I'm out for a walk trying to clear my head and shake the darkness free in nature, when I stumble upon a group of men being intimate with each other. Again I watch from the sidelines, then again I join in. Then again I feel better.

I have zero attraction to any of these men, or really any other men for that matter.  It for some reason this action, this fulfillment of some sort of trauma bond, makes me feel better for short times.

I've always been safe about it, but I can't keep leading this double life. 

I've gone without that sort of contact for 4 weeks now and I'm staring very worryingly at firearms, ropes and such.

I can't tell her this, or my therapist. 

But I'm just about done

4455,"This is pathetic, but I don't know where else to go.I've had a long history of mental illness, complete with one near-successful suicide attempt about five years ago. Recently, I was on the upward swing--feeling good, on a good combination of the right meds, and hadn't self-harmed in almost two years. I was on my way out of therapy, and had been transferred from a specialist to a GP.
Two weeks ago, it was my birthday. I usually hate birthdays, but I managed to have fun this year; I got myself balloons, went out to dinner, saw my boyfriend and got a piercing I'd wanted for months.

Two days ago, I started noticing signs of infection. I went today to get antibiotics, and was planning on gently and quickly switching the jewelery from a ring to curved barbell for comfort's sake. I snapped the ring against my cartilage while taking it out, caused a ton of bleeding and swelling, and couldn't get the barbell in. I am in hysterics. It seems this is all it takes to bring the flood of sadness and suicidal thoughts back.

I want to die. And not because I lost my piercing, but because I am a fucking pathetic piece of shit, who makes a big deal out of everything, ruins everything, makes everyone around me miserable, and generally is a worthless waste of oxygen. I have no future and no one would miss me who wouldn't be better off without me. I am a monster. I am a failure. I am ugly, fat, and volatile. I'm stupid. I'm generally a compilation of every awful quality on the face of the earth, and all it took to remind me was one little failure. Yay for being weak.

I've cried myself sick already, have ruined a late birthday dinner, and am on the verge of breaking my blades back out. The only thing stopping me is that my sheets are white and I don't want to have to clean up the blood.

4787,"Revenge Suicide?Honestly I think I'm *broken* as a person. I remember when I was maybe 5 or 6, I would wake up and be excited that everyone was already wake, and I could go watch teenage mutant ninja turtles. My Dad and Mom divorced when I was in third grade, and I think this is where all of this started.
 
Things are different being a 31 year old, living in a 3rd floor apartment.
 
**Current Situation :**

*I have no job, I got fired for getting a phone number from a new girl that started, I work in IT so I had access to the employee info. (I asked her very respectfully if I could take her out for lunch)

*I kicked out my girlfriend right before Christmas because she was talking to some other person. (Honestly she was a mean snappy person anyways, that didn't appreciate me, but I enjoyed having someone to be there for me, even if she was a distraction of how I felt inside. It made me feel better knowing that I was helping her get her life on track again.)

*My Dad and I don't talk very often, and when we do he's always asking for help fixing his computer or getting his groceries (I live 2 1/2 hours away from him)

*My Mom is very stubborn, never really can ask or talk about deep down - about feelings or how she really feels about things.

*I had been on Prozac (8 months) and then changed to Cymbalta (took that for about 3 months) and I just weened off about 30 days ago. I wanted to get off of it because it generally made me that I didn't care about consequences (probably had something to do with messaging the girl about a lunch date).

I've noticed I'm easily irritated, generally down , and have been staying up til 4 am. 

**I sometimes think that if would be satisfying, to break-in to my old job, and shoot myself in the cube of the girl that got me fired.**

I intern for a software company and have been for the past 2 months, so I'm familiar with project management stuff. Long story short, the one project that was important to the president, I somehow fucked it up and he literally shouted at me in front of the whole software team for over an hour about everything I did wrong and kept being patronizing and clearly thought i was too stupid to grasp the concepts.

 I'm also a senior in college with a 4.0 but a point of insecurity has always been that the university I go to is pretty low end (in a low income city with a high acceptance rate), and everyone else I work with (literally every one of them) has gone to a nationally acclaimed school that has a very selective acceptance rate. The fact that even with a 4.0, i cant keep up with normal people is pathetic and i feel beyond worthless. On top of that, i am the only female on the software team and I am African American (both things I am acutely aware that people look down on me in my field for being).

Watching my grandfather on his deathbed getting his diaper changed made me realize that humans live too long in this world. I vowed that would never be me. I have lived my life since with the hope of a heart attack at 50. I smoke a pack of cigarettes every day, which I call procrastination suicide. I eat fast food like it's going out of business. I'm not fat I'm just really unhealthy.
About a month ago I told someone I thought I could trust about this plan. They promptly called the cops on me. After kicking in my front door and bedroom door 4 cops pinned me down with knees in my back to put handcuffs on me and shipped me off to a mental hospital. Today I received the $1800 bill for the ambulance ride. 
I have been home for about a week. While in the hospital I got enrolled in Healthcare for the first time in about 3 years.  However they wouldn't start me on medication, diagnosed bipolar, because I didn't have a Primany Care Doc. 
The day I left I got set up with a doc who is nice and genuinely seems to want to help.  But I am caught up in beurocratic hell with 4 health insurance companies who all want me to see different doctors in their network to give me access to what they think I need.

I don't want to do any of this. I don't want meds that will turn me into a fucking zombie. I don't want people to think they can change my life plan. I don't want to ever have to deal with police again. Fucking assholes.  I just want to be left alone and to die in peace.

This whole ordeal has done nothing for me except expedite the process in my mind. A heart attack will no longer suffice. I can't make it another 20 years in this shit hole of a world.

15353,"My only regretMy head is completely messed up. It's become harder and harder for me to see the point in doing anything anymore, and i think people are starting to notice it. 
I've become so used to putting up a facade around other people, but i don't even know what I'm trying to hide because the true version of me has never really had the chance to exist. All the things that used to bring me just a little bit of joy, is starting to feel like a chore that i have to do to keep up the persona that i have created for myself.
I would consider this past year to be both the best and the worst year of my life. I would consider it to be the best because I've been able to push all my emotions away for long periods of time and I've become more social, but everything of course comes with a consequence. Because of this my life has become so dull and whenever i lack the ability to push my feelings away anymore, they come back at me like a big wave and it becomes bigger and harder to escape that wave every time. And every time i think im about to reach the surface of the water i get pushed down again. 
Even though i have many absolutely amazing friends,  i can never really tell them how i truly feel, because i don't wamt to burden them and they'll never fully understand it.

I proceeded to go to the bathroom and throw up for 30 minutes, before i finally decided to yell for my mother. If i had just waited for 10 more minutes i would have been dead.

393,"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up, never have to feel a thing again. I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression, free from the cage of anxiety and panic.

I'm in an abusive not-marraige, I can't tell anyone what's happening to me or they'd try to help and make it worse. 

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I love my children so much. I hide all this from them, they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

In addition to that, I am now being evaluated for an uncommon and highly stigmatized disorder.

I just want to have a normal life.

I am an orphan, there is nowhere to run. I have tried.

13032,"I would like someone to talk toOn the surface, I live a great life. I am a 17 year old Austrian guy, come from a well to do family, go to a good school and get decent grades. I am well liked, but known to be more of a quiet and not so social guy, but incredibly intelligent and I seem to get along with everyone. I have my hobbies: hiking, mountain biking and building Lego sail boats and would be considered far above average attractiveness in terms of my physical appearance by most people. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that on the inside I am a wreck. It's hard to even describe how I really am on the inside. Recently I have contemplated suicide a couple of times. I get anxious and paranoid in social settings, I don't feel strong emotional bonds to anyone and spend more time in my head creating idealized versions of my life and the people around me, than I do in real life. Because of this I feel as though I have nobody to talk to because nobody who knows me would believe me. I have tried talking to people in my class, however they only see my outside. I am terrified of failure and even my own thoughts sometimes. I am manipulative and a compulsive liar, but nobody sees it. I would do anything to look good and the lengths I have gone to do so, have always horrified me in hindsight. 

&amp;#x200B;

My outlook on the future is also depressing, as I see no point in working hard and getting good grades in school, to get into a university to study for 3 years, and then to work and be miserable for 40 years to make money to survive and then live out the rest if my life as an old man, with no use for any money I end up making.

15283,"Suicidal thought buildupI get regularly depressed; it's been that way for a really long time. And until this past few months I've managed to keep it under control. I pushed myself out of bed, showered, went to class, swam as a workout, etc. I graduated last summer and moved in with my girlfriend (she's wonderful).

But, as of now I have had a lot of job submissions and interviews but have landed nothing. As everyone is aware, living is expensive, and I've seen my bank account just chip away as I look around for employment. I can barely afford the basics for my girlfriend and myself. And those old thoughts, those deep dark *sad* thoughts, have caught up with me. Those thoughts that *you're worthless* or *you can't do anything right*, creep up on me even when I'm doing fine.

Simple critiques of me just have devastating effects: I lose my sense of hunger, I don't sleep; thinking of what I did wrong, my everyday motivation and creativity just evaporate. Then those feelings make me less social and more irritable and then I realize I'm not treating people as well as I should be... The cycle continues in this negative feedback loop.

And it's just accumulating to a point where I find myself thinking about killing myself on a regular basis. I know that ending my life will be a living nightmare for those that I love and care about. It will follow my parents, my brother, my girlfriend and her family, and my friends until they die.

But I just *can't* keep going on like this. I'm probably not giving my wonderful girlfriend the love she deserves. Right now all I feel is that deep gut hurt, the empty feeling that just sucks color away from life. I just need help. Maybe a little space and a soft cry will help. I honestly didn't think I would be showing my thoughts anywhere, especially on the internet. To whomever is reading this, thank you. I hope you are OK.

I have no child support, I live with my mother and she is a hopeless narcissist. Every day is a torture. Everyday I hope I have the courage to jump infront of the train. Nobody would miss me! They all have stated how fucked up i am and nobody needs me. I was doing well, but that was an illusion, everything was a lie. I'm such a loser.

There was just alot of me crying because I had lost my friend (at this point he wasn't someone I though of as my ex partner, he was just my best friend) he drove me home and couldn't help but just sit in silence.

7738,I have suicidal thoughtsHello to everybody reading this. I don’t really know how to put those feelings into words. I am a boy and I like boys. That is not my reason for feeling depressed. I am 28 and I am in a difficult situation. I like a boy who is in a relationship with another man for 3 years. I met him online on accident and we hit it off. We spend a week together and then he went to his boyfriend who is not living in the country I live. The boy I like is liking me back but says he has a relationship and he does not consider anything else. The fucked up thing is that we have much more in common but he is not able to respond to my feelings. Here comes what I have been suffering for the past two years since we met. I tried to be as attractive as possible with gaining weight and  dropping it again. I am to the point where I don’t want to see myself in the mirror. I feel so bad and constantly down. I try to do things to get my mind off this but it does not work. I feel such pain that I tries self harming because it helped a little just by causing physical pain. I can’t tell my friends and actually nobody that I want to kill myself and I feel that way. Thats why I decided to make a profile here and search for some help/advice. I don’t think that people like me in other ways than as a friend. I probably don’t have what it takes for being something more to people. I am accepting this but I struggle with the pain of rejection and the fear of being constantly looked as just somebody to talk to. I feel trapped and the only escape I see is to end all this.

9567,"I'm so lost. Help me please.I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've completely ruined my whole damn life.

Almost 2 months ago I broke off the engagement with my ex who I was with for 18 months, and now I hooked up with a girl and her and I were together for 3 weeks and I loved the sex and the relationship. But alas, I couldn't stop thinking of my ex.

Well her and I broke up last Friday, and right after her and I broke up, I went and slept with my ex. Now I don't know what I want. I have 2 girls who really want me, and I don't know who would be better for me. I feel something for both of me. And I'm getting pressured into making a decision.

I stopped taking my anxiety meds because they made me want to harm myself even more than I already do. I just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I find myself skipping class, and I'm supposed to graduate with my degree this semester and I'm fucking everything up.

This isn't me, and I don't know how to find myself anymore, and I just can't take this. I hate myself. I hate looking in the mirror. I was hurt by my ex, but I keep thinking what if shes changing for the better and I can be happy. But then I have people telling me that the other girl is better for me, and not to go back to my ex.

I care so much what other people say/think and I absolutely hate hurting people. And in this situation someone has to get hurt whether its my ex or this new girl. God, I really hate this so damn much.

I tried hurting myself the other, all I could do was hold the knife up against me but I couldn't go through with actually doing anything. I want to feel physical pain because that's better than the mental pain I'm going through. 

I'm so stressed and it eels like there is no ending to this train wreck.

1104,"Sick Of The LonelinessI have been at an all time low these past few months.  I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since I was about 8 or 9.  I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.

11540,"my suicide noteI'm sitting here, on a night almost like any other, feeling utterly defeated and disappointed in myself. I can't quite comprehend why I'm so self-destructive, nor can I understand why I'm so unappreciative of the wonderful life I had been given. I'm aware that there's nobody to blame for the way I've been feeling these past few years except for myself. This guilt is stacked so heavily on my chest, like a pile of bricks dragging me down every day- being such a burden or even a plague to my life that I just want to succumb under the weight of it all. I'll never be able to explain the feelings of loneliness and isolation that I felt on a day to day basis. There's absolutely no way I'd be able to tell my mother, someone who breathed life into me and nurtured me with all the love she's had to give, that her baby doesn't want to be alive anymore. It's easy to comprehend that I'm not alone, in terms of others feeling the exact same way as I am feeling at this very moment, but it's difficult to find even a hint of solace in knowing that. I would NEVER wish these feelings upon anyone. I thought I could be saved- as if my problems would just magically disappear as soon as I reached out for help, but that obviously wasn't the case. I wish everyone the best. In their schooling, their careers, with their health, their successes, and their friends/family. This is simply too much for me to handle and I am not strong enough to carry on. After 16 years, I believe I finally realized that it's nearly impossible to truly feel joy whilst battling the worst, most relentless demons in my head. I'm sorry for not being the friend you wanted me to be, the daughter you wanted me to be, the student, the niece, the cousin, the person, I'm sorry.

387,"I want to put my family through this.I am 23 years old and my entire family (four siblings and my mom) stopped talking to me last month. They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks. Or do what they say after they betrayed me like that. I think what my family did to me and is doing to me now is disgusting, it fills me with rage and sadness because I also feel like at this point I can't (and shouldn't) ever forgive them. They will never apologize and I don't see how that gets fixed without an apology. I have all the criteria for suicide and have been suicidal in the past, I can't believe they are abandoning me like this it puts me at a higher risk for suicide and I wish I would do it just to make them feel bad. Just to get them to see the seriousness of the situation. I'd love to post on facebook that the decision was made because on top of feeling like I have nothing left to live for and feeling like I can't cope with my pyschiatric issues anymore (or the side effects of the medications) my family doesn't care what happens to me either so what's the point?

1449,"I could have graduated this week but I ruined all my chances... this is it for me, I'm doing itI've been struggling with depression and social phobia for the last years, and although suicidal thoughts have been recurrent, this is the first time where I feel committed to it.

I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).

This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 

I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

So yeah, I am ashamed but this is it. Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible.

6772,"Turbulence before the descentI thought my last post here would be my last one for a while, but here I am again.

I feel so very lonely. I haven't heard from my best friend in a long time, and I don't know when he's coming home. My new friend has been, and will continue to be, out of reach for some time. I've honestly got no friends at home to speak of.

My existence is one within a dysfunctional family. Every day is a struggle to survive the onslaught of verbal and mental abuse that my sibling deals out to our parent and myself. It really wears us down.

I told myself when I come home from college that I was going to work hard to better myself, but that's not been the case. I haven't had the drive or willpower to work out and build a better body or study the subjects that I need to master. I just feel tired and numb everyday.

I miss feeling. I miss feeling a sense of belonging among others. I think I need that to keep going. I need appreciation and validation. Maybe it's time I look for someone to love. I know it's not the best time, I'd be lying to myself otherwise. The best time to look for someone would be when I'm stable, independent, and strong. But based on how everything's been going, I don't know when I'll get there. I might need to just let someone who could love me help.

I hope I don't make the same mistakes along the way that could bring me to a darker place. All I know is that I'm worn down. Everything I do is so that I can support my family and a future partner.

As long as I remember what I'm fighting for, maybe I'll better be able to fight the urge to end the pain of it all. But if it gets to be too much, I'll save the resources to go out on my own terms. I really hope it doesn't get there. Sorry for rambling.

8417,"I guess I'll ventOkay so I'm 13 and before you say ""oh you're too young to be suicidal and depressed. You haven't gone through anything"" Yes I fuccing have. I guess I started feeling sadder than usual when my biological father moved away in the beginning of 2018 (my mother and him divorced when I was about 2) I missed him but also hated him for leaving me and being abusive to my mother. I also   have had a lot of surgeries because I have a pacemaker. It makes me feel a little bad when I can't do things such as riding a rollercoaster with my family. But that's all fodder compared to what the big problems are. I made a really really bad decision and my family kinda hated me after that. It made me start to feel like nobody loved me and I became suicidal. I started self harming because it made me feel a little better and I thought everything would be okay and I would eventually stop but I didn't. So now my arms and hands are covered with healed and new scars which makes me feel even worse because I feel like I'm too ugly to be loved. I feel like nobody cares about me, like everyone just wants to be rid of me. My best friend stopped talking to me for whatever reason (I moved schools this year so we could only text each other) And everyone at this school just treats me like a pile of trash, because of the aforementioned really really bad decision. The only thing that makes me happy is my boyfriend (yes I am only 13 and shouldn't be dating ik) and he's the only person who makes me feel loved.

8709,"I want outI want out.

The title basically says it all. I grew up being forced into a wheelchair when I was capable of walking. Got bullied for it. Whole childhood I was emotionally neglected by both my parents and singled out. I will never forget how my mom told me “you are my child. I love you but I will never like you”. Always being told how they don’t understand how I have friends. They told me I was a mean child. That I am the reason behind my other siblings mental illness. I can’t do anything right. Every boyfriend I’ve ever had has cheated on me - Including my current partner who lives with me at my parents house. I have no hobbies, no close friends, not good at anything. I attempted suicide at age 15, my mom told everyone I was attention seeking and was lying and refused to take me to the hospital after I overdosed - my cousin pleaded after my mom told everyone they weren’t allowed to take me and finally did. Was raped at age 15, he took my virginity and then died last year. I’ve been bulimic since I was 14; I’m 20 now. I’ve lost all hope in life. Everyday is worse than the last. I found diary entries from when I was 5 talking about how I was going to hang myself. More diary entries from when I was 7. And 10. Nothing’s changed so when will it ever. It was supposed to get better and it never has. I feel like I have ruined my entire family. I have friends but no one chooses to reach out to me - or take any interest in inviting me anywhere. I’ve truly always believed I was better off dead and I’ve been proven right in my opinion. I just want the numbness to end.

10186,"Just fvcking kill meBack in October I was kicked out of a apartment because the couple I was living with were moving into a house. I had nowhere to go. I threw away so much shit, I'd never use. During that time, I had no income. Just barely getting by with a little help from dad here and there. But during that time I was so fucking depressed all the time. Sleeping so much, watching porn. Seeing a woman naked isn't the same anymore. Just like meh. But I was staying at my bands studio space. Even though I wasn't supposed too. I would find enough change to pick up peanut butter and bread. That's all I would unless my good friend came and picked me up. We would head to the movies and get free pop and popcorn because we knew the staff. So it was nice to eat something different for once. Plus it was nice to not be alone in a studio room with windows but they are covered for sound damping purposes.. so I would hardly see the light of day unless I went out which was rare during the day. I was lucky to enough to not get kicked out of my band, because I was scared I was. I've never been okay since i graduated high school. I thought of  college but my depression would only get worse because I know I would be made fun of. I don't know, I never went so that could be a lie.. 

But as time went on, I found a job. Then my friends needed a roommate, and I joined them. Everything was okay for awhile but since being isolated for like a month. I feel like I'm back in October again. With no money. No desire to be happy, alone here at the studio. Every fucking day. Sleeping on the couch. Dreaming of my funeral. What I would write to my friends and family.

3157,"Relationship activities? So recently I have been working on self improvement, and trying to to be the best version of myself. I wasn't it the shape that I wanted to be in, and found myself becoming not focused and lazy. I have spent time on that, and recently developing better workout routines, and study habits. Skip to yesterday, I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while. I decide that it is the time, and my boy (who also has a gf) has been hyping me up. For the longest time I wanted to ask her out but assumed she would reject me. I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot, and try to improve from this situation. Anyway, I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased. She said she would love to, and we have been texting a ton since. She said that she had a crush on me too, and I was so glad it worked out. I have been in relationships before, but niether really count as they were just 2 flings. I'm familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago. That wasn't really a relationship either, as the person who asked her never did much, and didn't treat her with much respect. I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently! I really want to have fun with her, and know that I will not just leave this as a fling. I have been thinking a lot about what things we should do together, and since there is a pandemic right now I know it will be difficult. Anyone who has been a relationship with someone (especially in COVID), it would be very much appreciated if you let me know some fun activities you have engaged in with your signifacant other!

When society rejects you, for being slightly different

With its humbling and treasuring billows at hand

Nothing remains which cannot stand

Anything unusual is attacked and considered to be defective

The world grows into dullness, stupifying itself slowly

Whataboutism, anti intellectualism, anti science on the rise, nothing, nothingness, reject the facts to seek out the alternative

The alternative universe that yet does not exist

It is fabricated for those who want to maintain a sense of truth, a lack of cognitive dissonance

So they of course adjust their worldview, and so it is right to them, a post truth society like no other

You watch, horrified, as it all comes undone

They all hate you because you are not the one

You cannot be the one, for you are merely you

You didn’t chose to have this placed on to you

The machine of production hums wearily

Nothing more to hand

There is nothing more to say

All of it has been said

Everything uttered, all for a ruse

Nothing is creative, all isn’t true

Facts are subjective, what’s right for me might not be for you

We all just put labels on ourselves, to assign unique value

For in a world without value, dehumanizing and systemizing

What else is there to do?

Society has crashed and our brains swirl around without wonder

There’s nothing left to ponder for it all has been pondered for you

Oh? You’re different? Don’t fit in?

We hate you, a quote quite prevalent, ubiquitous perhaps

For change is scary and I’ll leave it at that

You look around, and you can see it clearly too

What is this place I have found myself anew

You find yourself in answers, in questions which others tell you not to ask

Politics are forbidden, shut yourself up alas

Don’t be different, conform, don’t go astray

Be safe, don’t stray, don’t experiment at all

Retain your homogenous viewpoint of the universe at large

You can’t have conflict, censor your opinions

12709,"I want to die because I’m boredI was depressed for a long time, due to the nature of depression I dreaded life in general, hated everything around me, and the few things I loved I could never quite reach. 

For a short period of time I was happy again. It must’ve been 2 or so years since I felt so real and in my body, of course not exactly like it used to be, but almost. 

Now I sit at a point where that freshness of New hope has faded, the reality has struck again, and although I wouldn’t say I’m as depressed as I was before, I’m even more dissociated from life and my body. 

Plenty of you will say the generic, “go out and find new hobbies!” Or “make plans with people!” But there are issues. I work out daily, I think I’m generally attractive, and have decent social skills, I have several hobbies, some of which I’m above average at, yet I don’t have many friends or close ones at least, I’m thankful for the few I do have. None of this seems to fix the fact that I’m bored, I can’t find enjoyment with my life. That every day cycle we all know so well seems to be recurring at speeds I didn’t think I’d ever have to endure. It feels like my life is a whirlwind of the same shit spinning in circles, faster than ever. 

Anxiety to loneliness to content throughout each day without any so to say “big event.” 
I understand not everyone’s life is a shit load of fun but for fucks sake could I have some? 

I don’t enjoy anything around me, sometimes I’m given the opportunity, I mean maybe I have plenty of opportunities that I’ve just become bored with. But I know this feeling all too well. 

Last time it led to addiction.

This time that isn’t possible. 

I don’t know what I’ll do, what I do know is that I feel alone and isolated no matter what I’m doing. No matter how much it seems like I should be hurting or yearning to find some motivation or happiness, my depersonalized mind doesn’t seem to... give a single fuck.

I hallucinate things that were traumatic like when someone stole my identity but now it's scary. I see myself hanging from a noose EVERYWHERE I GO and I see people crowding around me telling me to kill myself and when that happens I break down. I can never take that. Even with friends I just crawl up and cry and scream. That does not help with everything else. Right now I'm in f****ing middle school and someone is stalking me which ABSOLUTELY does not help with the hallucinations. I practice suicide every other day just to get used to it. To normalize it. To prepare. I have 2 reputations. 1. The depressed kid that you should stay away from because he's probably going to shoot up a school. Or he's the joker. I'll explain the joker. Because I have depression my version is that happiness is dull and short. When I want to laugh I can't and I don't want to be a mean person so I want to laugh but I have bad sound control so I just scream laughing followed by a cough cause I've been sick for like 4 months, then partner that with my random crying coughing and sometimes laughter and you get the joker.

6792,"What draws the line between suicidal ideation and active plans?Like how can someone tell if you have an active plan enough to have you sent away?
Like I have very vivid suicidal thoughts to the point where I know multiple ways how and have the means easily accessible but it's not like I'm telling anyone I plan to commit on X day at Y time. I just have suicidal thoughts in excessive detail. 

If i said ""I just gotta dump all my crap in the garbage or a storage unit, maybe get some shit paid off cuz i heard debts fall to the family, and maybe I'll see if I can't take a vacation real quick and all i have to do is x my wrists no big deal"" I dont see that as a plan. Or even ""I'm taking antidepressants but if i were to kill myself i don't see any reason why i couldn't just pool all my pills together n take them all at once with the door locked or something."" Like if i said those things i dont think that's an active plan.

To me an active plan is someone that already has the means right in front of them or nearby and cant hear the word ""Stop."" Or someone who says if nothing changes in a week im finally going to do it. Idk how but I'll do it. Prepping wills and letters to be distributed afterwards also seem like a sign of an active plan. 

And no im not knocking or judging anyone whose ideas and plans dont align or match with the crap I'm saying, i would never, im just...
I don't know.

Am i missing something? I just wanna be careful with what i say about my suicidal thoughts when I finally meet with a therapist (should they ask ofc). Like i don't wanna be misconstrued as having a whole active plan and have people show up and take me away to some institution or whatever.

7887,"I don't even know what to tell my 20M friend anymore. All his reasons for wanting to end his life are valid and I have no idea how to dissuade him from killing himself anymore.My buddy and I are both 20. At age 8, my buddy was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome. He turned out to have a very bad case and struggled throughout school. He eventually had brain surgery at age 12 to get probes in his brain and a battery pack put into his chest area. This ended up being unsuccessful, and he had to go into surgery again 2 years later to deactivate/remove the probes. He dropped out of high school in 10th grade because it was unbearable. He has awful physical and verbal tics. He will swing his arms, hit things, hit himself, yell, cuss, say nigger at the worst possible moment, etc.

He has been living with his parents his whole life and currently has no future prospects. He sits at home all day and smokes weed and plays video games. He's relatively privileged, he uses his college fund to buy fun things because he doesn't have anything else to put money towards. He has a Vive, ps4, nice PC, all that stuff, but he's still heavily depressed. 

About a year ago, he still talked about suicide a lot but promised his parent's he'd wait until he was 25 to see if the tourettes were gone or if anything has improved.

8554,"The more I think about it, the more suicide makes sense.Hi, 
I've been lurking in this particular thread for close to a year and have posted some stuff too. 

But the more I think about it the more ending my life makes most sense. Here is the watered down version of my background: 

Husband and I separated very early this year (it was coming) and I met a man who talked the talk but never walked the walk -- what can I say, I was vulnerable and easily swayed. 

I find out that I am pregnant, and tjevsaid man pushed me for an abortion -- I refused. I had two abortions and a miscarriage in my lifetime and did not want to go through with that again. He called me all sorts of names (and this is a guy who calls himself a feminist) -- have not spoken to him in months. 

I have chronic depression and as the due date draws near, all I can think of is killing myself and my baby -- I think that will be the best possible solution for everybody. 

I feel like my husband, my daughter (I have a child with my now separated husband), the baby, and myself will all have a better future/outcome if I jump off high building (my preferred method of suicide). 

Single motherhood is hard, although some people can pull through I am not sure if I can -- once upon a time I thought I could. I thought about adopting the child out but that doesn't appeal to me either. I don't know -- I can't think straight and I can't do anything right. 


EDIT: Thanks for all the comments guys. It's been excruciatingly hard for me in the past six months. I have no idea how I got into this mess and I was taught better than this. I am just so ashamed of myself, facing the colossal task of being a single mom while still being a student (went back to get my MSW degree this January), and the thought of how I messed up my life.... All these make suicide seem like a very attractive way out with minimal damage. I don't know anymore.... I just don't know....

The people in my life have cut me out because I am no longer fun to be around. I'm sorry, but the desire to want to kill myself makes it difficult to clap my hands and dance for you.

We don't really have access to guns in my country. However, I often think of taking one to my temple and imagining the sudden nothing that will free me from this dread, this despair and desperation I have accumulated for myself. Maybe if I didn't seek sympathy or empathy in this world I would be better off. Or wish to feel desired or have someone to come home to, maybe if I was OK with being alone for the rest of my life.

Without the courage to commit the act, I just wait in darkness, in silence. Every day while I bring myself to tears surrounded by nostalgia and memories. Sometimes I remind myself of the old feeling, the warm feeling you get when you remember something from way back. Those memories seem to bring more pain than my desperation now.

3326,"I really fucking hate my class (9th grade btw)
I’ve never really liked them that much but I could hang out with them and all but now it’s just too much. The amount of casual racism and other shitty stuff is being said, not only to me (I don’t really care that much cause I don’t care about them tbh. I’m biracial btw so apparently that makes me black or something according to them) but to anyone that isn’t native to the country. “Immigrant” and the N word and all sorts of other racial slurs are being said regularly and it’s starting to piss me off. I’m a non confrontational person so I just keep quiet but god I’m dying inside whenever the hell they open their mouths.

They have to make mean comments and make fun of people’s appearances all the time. In real life and even just watching someone in a movie or a documentary. Stop and be respectful for gods sake. 

They disrespect teachers, don’t respect their privacy (searching through my teachers google search history on his personal PC while he wasn’t around) make fun of muslim teachers for their religion and of course racial slurs (never to their face of course cause they don’t wanna get in trouble) 

They disrupt the class all the time. 2 girls laugh every 30 seconds almost and it’s distracting and annoying, one boy has the mentality of a 7 year old. 

They gotta make fun of accents, make fun of movements, make fun of clothing, make fun of what music people listen to, make fun of people’s jobs, make fun of people’s education, make fun of what phone you have and all sorts of other bullshit that literally does not fucking matter but they take time out of their day to make fun of the smallest things and it’s so stupid, mean and pointless that it actually makes me angry to the point of me writing this to let out my anger (cause like I said before I never speak my mind) they even made fun of people with conditions like Down syndrome because “they look funny” keep in mind these people are 14-16 years old and it’s unbelievable how fucking immature they are at that age.",non-suicide,"i really fucking hate my class 9th grade btw ive never really liked them that much but i could hang out with them and all but now its just too much the amount of casual racism and other shitty stuff is being said, not only to me i dont really care that much cause i dont care about them tbh im biracial btw so apparently that makes me black or something according to them but to anyone that isnt native to the country immigrant and the n word and all sorts of other racial slurs are being said regularly and its starting to piss me off im a non confrontational person so i just keep quiet but god im dying inside whenever the hell they open their mouths  they have to make mean comments and make fun of peoples appearances all the time in real life and even just watching someone in a movie or a documentary stop and be respectful for gods sake  they disrespect teachers, dont respect their privacy searching through my teachers google search history on his personal pc while he wasnt around make fun of muslim teachers for their religion and of course racial slurs never to their face of course cause they dont wanna get in trouble  they disrupt the class all the time 2 girls laugh every 30 seconds almost and its distracting and annoying, one boy has the mentality of a 7 year old  they gotta make fun of accents, make fun of movements, make fun of clothing, make fun of what music people listen to, make fun of peoples jobs, make fun of peoples education, make fun of what phone you have and all sorts of other bullshit that literally does not fucking matter but they take time out of their day to make fun of the smallest things and its so stupid, mean and pointless that it actually makes me angry to the point of me writing this to let out my anger cause like i said before i never speak my mind they even made fun of people with conditions like down syndrome because they look funny keep in mind these people are 14 16 years old and its unbelievable how fucking immature they are at that age ",378
3944,"my friend hanged himself Hello Reddit

Yesterday I received a message from someone claiming to be the brother (let's call him Daniel) of an old friend of mine (and call him Robert). He messaged me using Robert's discord account so I had no clue if it really was his brother. Daniel started asking me questions about me and the relationship I had with Robert. We were only friends and nothing more. We haven't talked in a year because last time we did, we had a pretty big fight since he couldn't accept the fact that I found myself a boyfriend. Robert was drunk and never talked to me ever again. Long story short, Daniel ended up telling me Robert hanged himself in his appartment last year, but was found two weeks ago. Now this is where things start to be weird, because if a body is hanging and left alone for a year at room temperature, he should be in an advanced decomposition state. Anyway, Daniel also told me about a letter Robert wrote for me and now I'm waiting for him to send it.

The thing is, I'm not sure I can believe Daniel. I knew Robert had a thing for me, but he never told me about having a brother, I think he is lying but isn't faking a suicide a bit over the top ? In the messages I received, there were many incoherent things. For example, Daniel asked me if I was Robert's ex-girlfriend, but only asked me later if I was a boy or a girl. If Robert was dead last year, wouldn't his neighbors start smelling the corpse ? Wouldn't his employer phone him ? Wouldn't his dog bark at his owner ? I tried calling him on his phone and it rang, which means it's not out of service. I'm asking myself so many questions and I'm not sure what to do, this is a very weird situation I never had to deal with before.

He's a republican, full on trump supporter and whatnot and I disagree with alot of his beliefs but that has never stopped me from respecting his opinion. The thing is, we're not even that different in terms of political beliefs. I'm a libertarian so economically speaking, I'm still very right wing. I just don't believe in stupid shit like being anti mask or supporting trump. I don't even hate trump, I just don't support him. 

But he thinks just because I support things like drug legalization (which I am VERY strongly for) and wearing masks, I'm some sort of liberal/leftist (as if that's supposed to be an insult, because of course all libt_rds are stupid SJW's who need to be #wrecked by *facts* and *logic*   ^/s )

Recently, all that he and his own conservative friends (republicunts, if you will) have been messaging me and shitting on my political views (despite the fact that they provide no real factual arguments, and any arguments they did provide I instantly discredited and provided my own counter argument which made them heated and angry while I maintained a cool head. It was quite entertaining actually, but still very annoying)

A bittt of a nudge here and everything would crumble down GRJDBJSNSHCK

All I've done is to spread hatefulness and pain, a loser with a rotten heart. If someone is dying on a sidewalk my selfish ass would laugh them off while casually eating a sandwich. A monster with no empathy whatsoever, a double-faced dickhead smearing shit one everyone's face, a hideous gunk of meat swearing and screaming on people who actually waste their time caring about it. Fuck this whole shit, this whole narcissistic self-absorbed pig lacking conscience and common sense about everyone and everything

All I've done is to gain trust only to break them and I didn't even feel bad about that!!!!!!!!!!! What a wonderful person!!!!!!!!!!!! I've fucked several people's lives, and here I am still breathing like a dying pig. Wish I could have just died back then, I got ""lucky""!!!!!!!!!!!!! (why do I call that luck I need to die lmao)

You all are beautiful people with your own flaws and good qualities. Please don't take your lives, the world needs you all... People who have contemplated their own deaths usually have tender hearts, this world is too fucked up for them. Please don't waste your lives, this world could be a utopia had every single one of THOSE SELF-ABSORBED ASSES actually cared and listened to your problems.

(unlike me lmao fuck this pig (sorry, pigs are muchhhhhhhh better than this filth, at least they make wonderful bacon strips))

(Pigs can't look into the sky, they wander around this shit hole their entire lives lmao)

Also I'm a fucking pedophile(!!!!!!!!THROW UP, SPILL YOUR GUTS OUT!!!!!!!!!) Don't worry, I'd be dead before I'd actually touch a single kid. I promise you that. After some preparations I would *POOF* be gone. One filth gone from the world. A FUCKING FILTH GONE FROM THE WORLD, I AM THE WORLD'S GREATEST JANITOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've been alone most of my life and the only thing I've ever wanted in life was someone to love who loves me back.  After about two months I was really starting to let my guard down and I was ready for things to get more serious.  I thought she felt the same.  Then out of nowhere she broke up with me.  She is a very successful attorney and I am...nobody.  She said she needed someone ""further along"" etc, which has been ringing in my ears for two years now.  I'm a failure, basically, who never had the ambition to achieve something like she did.  I haven't dated anyone else since.

I know that's not the full story, obviously she felt we just weren't meant to be together, but it never stops stinging for me.  I still like her so much.  I don't know how to stop.  I feel like even if I do meet someone else I'll still always wish I had been able to make it work with Her.  Just so tired.

13345,"I don't know what to doYesterday I messed up. I got wind that my fiance was probably getting the shit scammed out of her. She told me about how she has over a million dollars on some off shore bank and it eventually will solve all our problems. I am skeptical and concerned, since I figured she isn't aware that she is probably being had. Ages ago, she told me her email password and I remembered it, so I thought I would go and see these emails from this ""bank"". Lo and behold it's some Nigerian prince tier shit with horrible grammar and formatting. It was even coming from a gmail address. I looked and saw the email history of this. She almost had to sell her beloved truck to pay money to these scummy people because she thought it was real. They asked for money orders so when it's paid, the money is just gone. I set up a filter to auto delete mail from them and sent them a very angry email. Last night I told her about this. I explained my motives and what was happening and that I didn't mess around with whatever else was in there. She was shocked I did that and she ""loves me but doesn't trust me as a friend anymore"". I voiced my skepticism with this bank stuff before and she alluded that to me not trusting her, so this was a last resort. I could have kept it to myself about what I did but that seemed dodgy to me and I felt it was right to tell her. If she leaves me, I will have no more will to live. What can I do? I've been with her 3 years and she is everything to me. Without her, I am just some nobody working 9 to 5 every day just to ""get by"". Why live if there is nothing for me but a life of living paycheck to paycheck with only student loans as a reason to work?

 so at the start of spring quarter i threw myself back into the game and try as hard as i could to keep up. I fell and got back up each day. Each day i went to class. I pushed and pushed myself to work harder, try harder, to stop being so depressed and im been doing ok(ish) but the school just sent a letter to my house stating that i flunked out of fall quarter and if i can't prove i attended class throughout the quarter i lose my financial aid and would have to pay it back for that quarter and lose it for spring and have to pay late fees on top of that. sometimes i feel that i like to set myself up for this kind of shit. i really wished i CTB sooner :(  .

I had to email my geology professor last night because this week I started having trouble finding all my assignments. This morning she emails me back saying that the reason I don't have my stuff is cuz I didn't do an exam that was due *last Sunday the 13th.*

""***Excuse me? What the hell did you just say?""***

I'm all caught up on my stuff, I check my grades, everything is fine, except I feel like I'm not doing enough work this week for geology.

But what the actual fuck. *How the fuck is she just gonna say ""sorry, it was there"" and give me a 0 when I know damn well it was never fucking there. At all. Ever. And it still isn't there. Anywhere. Nowhere in sight.*

I haven't fucking did anything, I don't fucking open up to anyone because I know if I do they'll feel uncomfortable and leave. The closest thing to opening up to my 'friends' is saying I have a problem with abandonment and shit. And that's only to a few people.

Then COVID happened, my internship got cancelled and everything got pushed back. On top of that my two internships are all I have to complete now and since I can't take them at the same time, I'm losing my full time status which means losing my Financial Aid. All this work over the last couple years just to get shut down at the end because of something completely out of my control. There's other stuff too, the severe anxiety and panic attacks I've been dealing with for years,  one of my only close friends straight up turned her back on me and stopped talking to me. I didn't take care of myself growing up and now have major tooth issues (multiple broken teeth, messed up teeth etc.) I can't smile and If I ever want to date someone what girl wants a guy with messed up teeth? I also don't have health insurance because college student so it's not like I can go get it fixed.

13243,"Spoke to Veterans Crisis hotlineWhen I was younger I thought about suicide quite a lot. At some point in my life I decided I was just going to ""zombie"" through living. Now, that's not to say I don't have moments of happiness or I don't do things for fun - I just decided I would live my life despite not really feeling like there was a point in it all. 

Recently someone at my base committed suicide. For some reason it got me thinking about it A LOT! I think about how he might have did it, what were his thoughts before he passed the point of no return, am I capable of doing the same? I decided last night to talk to a suicide hotline for veterans. The person I spoke to kept referring to helpless and hopeless thoughts and feelings - and I've seen that sentiment in many of the posts here. I don't feel any of those things. I don't have an amazing life, but I don't feel like it's a horrible one either. I just don't see a point in anything. The best way for me to explain it, is to paraphrase a monologue from the beginning of the movie ""The Art of Getting by"": “Since the dawn of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world.  And not a single one of them made it.  There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.  Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.  That comes out to about 160,000 per day.  I read this quote once when I was a kid, “We live alone, we die alone.  Everything else is just an illusion. ”  It used to keep me up at night.  We all die alone.  So, why am I supposed to spend my life working, sweating, struggling? For an illusion?  Because no amount of friends, no girl, no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect or determining the square root of the hypotenuse is gonna help me avoid my fate.""

Does anyone else have this problem of wanting to commit suicide, not because of hardships and struggles, but because there honestly isn't a point in living.

369,"I just want her back.Me and my ex girlfriend had been going out for over a year. I loved her more than anything and to be honest I still do. She was my whole life, we did everything together, we went out pretty much every night and every weekend. She was my only friend

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again. At school I have no friends anymore, when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that, so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me

I can't even try to be friends with my ex because she can't even look at me and she won't tell me why. 

It's eating me up. I can't live like this anymore.

11613,"My co-workers don't know how much I suffer at workBackstory: Six years ago I was involuntarily hospitalized for 35 days. It was an experience that made me never trust mental health professionals again. I stopped having nightmares about it 2-3 years ago, but the flashbacks have continued beyond that.

I eventually got a job teaching college-level computer science and statistics. At work we have what is known as ""admin time"" which is when you get paid an hourly wage on top of your normal salary for doing miscellaneous administrative tasks. Usually you have admin time during hours when you don't have any classes to teach. The most common tasks needed to be done are auditing student records, which are in binders on a shelf, and photocopying documents. Both of these require a lot of standing for prolonged periods of time, which hurts my back. But there are other tasks too that require less standing.

When I have admin time I usually have to work with the part-time office administrator who also happens to be an MSW student and mandated reporter who wants to eventually become a privately practicing psychologist. Admin time would usually start out OK, but then my back would start hurting. I'm not sure what the co-worker is mandated to report but I'm not taking any risks. I still remember the last time I was involuntarily hospitalized and it wasn't fun. I also dislike being touched, so I would like to avoid getting sent to massage therapy (or any kind of unpleasant treatment) for my back.

Usually I would let my boss know but there is no way I could without the co-worker overhearing us, and the boss would probably let her know anyway because of the nature of our teamwork. After a couple hours, the pain would become unbearable. That's usually when I sit down to rest for a bit when neither the boss nor the co-worker are looking. I always get enough of the task done to satisfy both of them, and they are always grateful for my help during admin time. But neither of them know what I have to go through to get it done.",suicide,"my co workers don t know how much i suffer at workbackstory six years ago i was involuntarily hospitalized for 35 days it was an experience that made me never trust mental health professionals again i stopped having nightmares about it 2 3 years ago, but the flashbacks have continued beyond that  i eventually got a job teaching college level computer science and statistics at work we have what is known as admin time which is when you get paid an hourly wage on top of your normal salary for doing miscellaneous administrative tasks usually you have admin time during hours when you don t have any classes to teach the most common tasks needed to be done are auditing student records, which are in binders on a shelf, and photocopying documents both of these require a lot of standing for prolonged periods of time, which hurts my back but there are other tasks too that require less standing  when i have admin time i usually have to work with the part time office administrator who also happens to be an msw student and mandated reporter who wants to eventually become a privately practicing psychologist admin time would usually start out ok, but then my back would start hurting i m not sure what the co worker is mandated to report but i m not taking any risks i still remember the last time i was involuntarily hospitalized and it wasn t fun i also dislike being touched, so i would like to avoid getting sent to massage therapy or any kind of unpleasant treatment for my back  usually i would let my boss know but there is no way i could without the co worker overhearing us, and the boss would probably let her know anyway because of the nature of our teamwork after a couple hours, the pain would become unbearable that s usually when i sit down to rest for a bit when neither the boss nor the co worker are looking i always get enough of the task done to satisfy both of them, and they are always grateful for my help during admin time but neither of them know what i have to go through to get it done ",374
12800,"My NephewsI feel like I'm at the end point. It's not a momentary thing. I've felt this way for a long time now and I'm ready to go. I have a diagnosis and am in treatment but it's not helping. If anything it gives me less hope that this is something that will pass long enough for me to get a foothold on life again.

The one thing keeping me from doing it right this minute is the thought of my nephews. We are especially close and their mother died of a heroin overdose two years ago. I don't want to subject them to the loss of someone else they care about and trust. Please understand, I love them dearly but when things get bad I almost resent them for being the one thing standing in my way. I know that that is fucked up but I really just want to die. I'm tired. 

I'm not in the most hopeful of positions in general. I'm 37. I'm crashing at a friend's (my nephews' dead mother's, actually) parents' place and have been for about eight months. I have a moderate to severe mental illness that has negatively impacted every aspect of my life since childhood (and not for a lack of fighting it). I have a shitty job at a grocery store and a part-time job admining websites for a non-profit. I can't even afford to rent a room. My world is always one minor problem from crashing down. I don't know. I could keep going on and on but the point is that there isn't a lot of hope and I'm not sure how much longer the thought of my nephews is going to keep me from offing myself. It becomes less and less of a deterrent each day. If I can't take it anymore and kill myself, if I subject them to the loss of another close family member, one they trusted would be there for them, am I a monster?

A year and a half ago, I left my normal high school, where I had a decent social life with people I had known all of my life, to go to an alternative school so I could graduate early. I graduate at 15 in July. I completed 52 credits at my local community college in two semesters and I am 16 right now. I took all online classes so I do not have any friends in community college. I also wouldn't fit in with them, I'm only 16. 

My parents think I'm inadequate because I hang out with my friends too much but truth is, I only have 2 friends left and I constantly feel like a burden to them because I always want to hang out with them since they are all I have. My 2 friends think I am inadequate because I am shallow, they have been ignoring me ever since I told them I got into my dream university. I think it's because I was too proud but I wanted to be because I always feel inadequate to them because I chose a different route in life and they think it's easier.

I’m only 27 and I married the wrong man.  I don’t love him.  We are not compatible.  I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back.  I cut off all ties but he found me anyway.  I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now were married.  I refuse to procreate with him.  I’m not dragging other human life into my misery.  He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.

His debt is following me.  They found my number.  Collectors call every day.  I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector.  My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call.  He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now.  I don’t answer my phone at all anymore.  He owes tens of thousands for student loans and he is pretending like they don’t exist.  He gets angry at me when I try to help.  I’ve given up on the subject.  It will be the ignored weight on our shoulders until the day I die.

My dog has fallen ill.  I have drained my account trying to save him, but now I am out of hope.  It breaks my heart seeing him lay on the floor not moving or eating anymore.  He is going to the vet one more time tomorrow.  Then I am taking him back to the shelter for good.

3366,"Questions about SuicideSo I've been considering suicide, I have a history of that shit. I'm in a bad depression. I don't know why I'm thinking of suicide. I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work.

1706,"LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities.

4546,"My school system is such bullshit. A little while ago, I made a post talking about my regional championship match. I didn’t think I made it. Well, I actually did qualify. I know, exciting. 

Guess what my school system chose to do.

NOT LET PLAYERS PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE TOURNAMENT!

Why? Because they are worried that other schools attending state would not have the same Covid rules as them. By the way, my school has one of the worst track records with the handling of covid. They just make rules but give no solutions, shocking. But, let’s give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, they are generally worried about students spreading Covid from other parts of the state. Well, that can’t be true because the entire regular was against teams from multiple counties with different rules! Every. Single. Match. So they only care now that students have achieved something. Just so you understand how the rules are, my school made my shooting team wear masks while firing. Yes we were indoors but every shooter was just under 7 feet apart from each other so it was just a rule for the sake of rules. Even better, no other county had this rule. So, their reasoning is bullshit at worst and incredibly inconsistent at best. That is basically their covid motto. That and gross mismanagement and incompetence. 

This doesn’t just hurt our county either. They let us compete for a slot at state and only made this rule today. This means that other students that are allowed to go to state won’t go because our player beat them. This means that some kid who has worked his entire season for this is being denied entry because another student who worked just as hard was also denied entry. I was shooting for about 4 hours a week at minimum for the past 4-6 months trying to be the best I could, and I can’t fucking compete. What good are sports if the competition is taken away?

I had to leave university because of my illness and I can't return. I loved studying, now I'm left without it I don't know where to go.

I had to sell most of my guitars and amps to eat. I can't gig, audition, jam properly anymore. 

I can't hold down even the shittiest, lowest-paying, bottom of the barrel job because I can't afford private treatment, government help is a long line of waiting lists away and my mood is never, ever stable.

I push my friends away during my mania and retreat from them during my depression. They're not therapists or doctors, they don't deserve to put up with my bullshit.

My family looks at me like a filthy layabout without a job, leeching off of society. 

Not only am I left without my instruments (bar one guitar, my oldest, I could never sell her) but my family guilt me into selling my other possessions. I get bullied into believing that I don't deserve to have them whilst claiming government support, that I should sell them first before using taxpayer money. 

My life is being destroyed piece by piece. 2 years ago I was studying full time, I was gigging weekly, I was respected by my family and despite my illnesses I was enjoying life. 

Today I'm tired. I know that even if I get a job I'll be tired. I'll be relegated to the next in line to the throne that's held by the desperately working woman, slaving away before returning to her castle too tired to live but too poor to even try. 

I want to hold out. I want to cling to hope, but it gets harder. Every week is harder than the last. Eventually I'll snap. No one deserves this.

&gt;I graduated from engineering in 2008. Got a job as a software engineer and turned it down to startup on my own. Did not go as expected. However, I did get some cashflow going when I tried something (A) but complicated that too much and messed it up.

&gt;Then, I got another opportunity to partner with a guy who was experienced. I went to another city to startup with him. Worked my ass off and established a base there, but he did not work and I ended up doing everything for next to nothing. Walked away from that with nothing. That company is now doing well (B).

&gt;I came back to my home city. One of my old customers offered me a contract and I almost got started working on it. However, in the last moment, Something did not feel right. Like If I took that up, I would not be happy and missed out on that opportunity (C).

&gt;If I had taken up any of those, I would be making a lot of money and I would have also had the free time to try out other things. Instead, I am still struggling at 25 with nothing to my name.

&gt;Did I mention that I had to drop my dreams as a very talented artist when I was young since my parents did not want to get into that? Now, the guy(s) who took that shit up are raking in money with animation, film making, camera guys, visual effects, artist, designers, etc.

11302,"Finally bounced back. You can too!![One second video of my life every day in 2017.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ITApQDEIA)

I had aimed to do a one second a day video for 2017; however, I filmed a second a day in 2017. My life went to shit as i did. I ended up nearly called it a day in 2018 after not leaving the house in months. I've finally bounced back. I even remember posting on here at one point, hence my return. 2019 is my year. Why can't it be yours too?

I almost shelved making the video as 2017 and onward was horrendous, and this video made it look great, but I suppose that’s what we do online. We post a highlight reel. We post positivity. We flex. But we forget that’s the case when we look at others, and envy what we see online; therein lies the problem! Don’t envy others. Envy the future you and what you might do!     Anyway, I edited most of this last year, but couldn’t go any further, so instead it’s here, well in part anyway. Reason being, I almost called it a day in 2018. I hadn’t got out of bed in days, hadn’t got out of the the house in weeks,  and hadn’t got out of my head in months. Luckily a few friends old and new, helped me bounce back, and man am I glad I was smarter than that and kept fighting. I’ve never been happier than I am right now. All I did was start believing in myself again and cut out those that didn’t believe in me, or had sabotaged me in the past. Oh and met the girl of my dreams. I’ve been in care, adopted, physically and emotionally abused most my childhood, in trouble with the police, homeless, bullied at work, all sorts, but I’ve kept going. So many amazing people have helped me along the way. I'm not looking for sympathy; I'm just saying if I can do it, why can't you? Someone loves you. Someone wants you to reach out to them. Life can be hard, but keep going. Don’t forget that.

Things have been rocky about us the last few days. I told him exactly how much debt I was in and he lost it. He wanted access to my bank accounts and if I was to spend money on anything uncessary or what he deemed wasteful he was going to break up with me. He also demanded I lose weight. So pathetic me of course submitted to his dad's coz I didn't want him.to leave me. And he still was giving me attitude saying he doesn't want to speak.to me coz he finds me to be disgusting. 

Today I had a busy day with work and then went to work on a group assignment so my brain was really distracted from.the issues going on in my love life. I was driving home feeling super motivated to finish my essay and he messages me. And my mood changed  instantly. I felt this shame and anger come.over me which got worse the more we spoke. He wants everything on his terms and when I politely said I didn't want to speak tonight so I could be in the right headspace for uni he called me a coward. Said I was the most selfish  person he had ever met. Which is funny coz he himself has has been battling depression for the last 10 years and as a result hasn't had a job or finished his degree in that time. I even went out of my way to help him with uni and pulled all nighter  to do his assignments. I guess that's why it really gets me down when he calls me selfish coz I feel like I do try to put his needs before mine.

12062,"18M, fleeting hope.I feel fake. I feel like I'm faking everything. It seems as if people who are really depressed are depressed at all times. They're actually struggling and it feels like I'm pretending. I've been thinking about suicide for a while, ever since the 7th grade. I feel like I can't talk to people about it without feeling like some loser. I can't talk to my friends about it because I feel like I can't trust them. I don't know if it's their fault or mine.

I used to try to talk about my feelings a lot with people, hoping they'd give me some good advice but I soon stopped when I realized no one really cares. It's like I'm talking to walls whenever I try to speak out on how I feel. When my friends are having heart to heart conversations I exclude myself from them because they won't want to hear about how I feel.

Reasons against killing myself is the financial burden on my mom and I don't want her to deal with another one of her children dying. My sister died of leukemia last year, she was about 8 years old. She was my mom's favorite; I've never had a close relationship to anyone in my family. Another reason is pain. 

I feel alone a lot. Even as I'm typing this I feel like I'm whining about something that I shouldn't even be whining about. I feel like I shouldn't even be depressed because other people suffer more than me. 

I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel repulsive. I believe I repel everyone who tries to speak to me. I hate my looks, my voice, the way I walk, how I can't hold a conversation, I hate that I don't trust anybody or that I feel like everyone is out to make my life worse. I hate the thought of growing up.

3587,"Day 3Hey guys, 

I'm surprised I'm still doing these updates, I honestly thought I would of given up after like one or two posts. This is a new achievement for me. 

First of all I just want to say thank you for all your support and concern, Ive had a lot of messages asking if I seen therapists or psychologists and yes, plenty! Tbh I think it's countless how many professionals Ive seen for my mental health. 

Anyway today was pretty unsuccessful. I didnt go to work, I slept all day and spent all day on my pc playing The Division and lying to everyone I know. I was suppose to see my ex tonight for a movie after work but I told him I was working too late and wasnt feeling up to it. Another guy from work who is obsessed with me also asked if I would see him for coffee and I ignored his message. 
Seeing people makes me so uncomfortable. 

I blocked both of them on my social media, including steam and just played games all day. 

That's it. My day was a typical day for me; ignore everyone and distract myself with games. 
I thought about death only once today and it was about how I'm going to tell my Mum. She hasnt contacted me directly (except through legal letters) in about a month so I'm sure she won't care I'm gone or already thinks i am. Eh, I might leave it alone and not tell her. 
I also need to some how work up the mental strength to go outside and simply get a note pad and pen so I can start writing my goodbye letters to those who I feel needs one.

7891,"Omg help wtf there is something wrong with meeeee 😭 Ok so I have a problem. A HUGE PROBLEM. 

I’m a sophomore in high school and in my entire life I have had 2 crushes. The first one was in 7th grade I liked this boy A LOT and we started talking. A few weeks went by, then there was a party. At this party, he said he needed to talk to me, so I was like “ummmmm ok” and basically he asked me out. The second he did, my interest in him died completely. 

My second crush started in 8th grade. We never talked that much but I rly rly rly liked him all the way through to 10th grade (now). Since the beginning of the school year we have become pretty good friends. Now it’s the autumn break at my school in Denmark so we haven’t seen each other for a while. As a result, we have gotten to texting almost everyday. I’ve had a creeping suspicion that he likes me bc I catch him staring at me in class, and bc he’s almost always the one who texts first. About 4 days ago, he brought up crushes. He was teasing me about liking a senior, which I obviously don’t bc I like him. Sooooo I tried to get him to stop talking about that by saying he loves this girl in our class, and he was like “no...” and then I suggested it was another person and he says no to that too. He admits to having a crush on a girl in our class, and there are only 4 of us (ik there are sooo few girls and so many boys in our grade). I knew where he was going with this bc the only other girl who I hadn’t mentioned except for me is openly gay. At this I freaked out and said I had to go play super smash bros with my brother. This was btw a total lie bc I’m the only one who likes that game my bro hates it.

So end of story now I don’t like my crush anymore.

11582,"OCD, you’re beginning to win.iv been dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder for most of my life. 
began showing signs when I was around seven, and was officially diagnosed sometime in middle school. 

I’m not a clean freak, I’m not a germaphobe. I’m pretty unorganized sometimes. 

Things I still do are:
•re writing notes because my handwriting was too big or sloppy during the time of writing them.
•begin touching items in stores (like touching clothe racks) and sometimes having to go back and do it again.
•having to touch corners of a room.
•having to write down specific phrase and time stamp  with said phrase.
•trichotillomania of hair on my head (obsessive urge to pull out hair on the body, mine being from my scalp.)
•excessive blinking 
•having to repeat phrases in my head
•knocking on wood
•having to take a picture and say a phrase every night when it turns 11:11 

and more I can not think of at this moment.  

it’s hard. I break down crying to myself because no matter the medication, or coping skills or help from others I still feel unsafe.
my ocd surrounds religion. iv had horrible thoughts of hurting God, saying horrible things about Him, and things such as that- things I would never do or say to anyone or any figure.
one of my most terrifying delusions is where I believed I had sold my soul (even talking about it is difficult) I honestly and truly believed I had in some way (even though I don’t practice anything like that)
No one could convince me otherwise. 

My ocd religious fears most likely came from the many private schools I attended (I’m from the south) I was already emotionally unstable with a difficult home life. I hate myself for being afraid of religion. I don’t hate religion, or God or anything- I don’t blame the schools, I blame myself. 

This might sound ridiculous to some people. I am just afraid of negative things happening because of the negative thoughts about God.
I’m also afraid of any other religious figure (Buddha, etc.) I respect all religions but I’m absolutely terrified to think or even talk about them.

14544,"My (m) friend (f) and I are really close and I need some advice I’m currently 15 and I’ve been friends with this girl for about a year. We dated for a couple of months in 8th grade, had a lot of fun, and then broke up for some reason that I still don’t understand entirely. We started texting last March during the first quarantine in the US. We’ve been getting closer since then and she’s really helped me get through a lot of mental health stuff that I’ve had to deal with in the last 8 months or so. 

I’ve realized over the past few months or so that I really enjoy spending time with her. I don’t know why, but she and I just have a really deep connection and I really enjoy it. She makes my day better when we talk and something about her makes sense in my mind; something that hasn’t happened with anyone else. 

We started face timing since I got an iphone a few days ago and I used to have these basically horror dreams where I was essentially tortured and killed. It’s been 3 days now and I haven’t had one since. It’s amazing.

I love her with every part of me and I’m not sure how to even deal with it. I’m stuck between telling her that I love her as more than a friend but I really don’t want to make things awkward. It’s really obvious that she looks at me as a very close friend, but nothing more. I don’t know how to either move past this or confront it. I don’t even know if all of this is just hormones even.

I really think that she could be someone that I marry 8 or 9 years in the future. I know life changes and people are different, but I’m not even exaggerating when I say that I have 5 or 10 people asking me a month if we’ll ever be a couple or if we are one. It hurts a little bit when people ask that.

412,"This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I’m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years I’ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we don’t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I’m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I’ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn’t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it’s been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I can’t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I’d be scared someone would find out, I’m scared I’d break down, I’m scared I’d lose my place in college.

I’ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasn’t forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didn’t know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now it’ll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long that’ll be anyways.

3027,"2 years ago I posted here and now I'm back.I posted here 2 years ago when it was almost my bday and I was freaking out. I think I also called the suicide hot line. Well 2 years of trying by ass off to be better at life and it's got worse. 
Now I'm almost 30. In April I will be. Since then I have had 2 jobs thinking that was the problem. Nope. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't but I think it's me. Went from one gob to the same one different company, same shit happened. So I switch it up and go to a different job entirely. Kinda. Gas station manager to manager of a beauty store. 
Same shit. Under paid for all the work I do with no help and then I get in trouble for things that are literally NOTHING to do with me. Super long stories that I'm not going to get into. Each time I left because I put my mental health before a shirt retail job. 
Any way now I'm lost and don't know what to do. Earlier I tried to post on financial help sub and got bombarded with so many horrible things that now I'm super right back into holy shit just kill you self mode. 
I've been told every thing I could possibly to do improve my life and career and I have tried everything thing. 
Right now I just want to hear about the good that can happen in life. I just need some hope I guess. If I could drink I would just drink and pass out and wake up and do it all over again like a zombie that I was for years and years in my early 20s. Now I have an ulcer and can't drink, and can't afford any of the drugs that I want to do to get me through this.

4736,"People say that committing suicide is selfish. But isn't telling someone not to commit suicide just as selfish?I have been thinking seriously about suicide for a while now. The only reason I havent done it, the one reason that I might not, is because I don't want to hurt the people who love me.
I've had two people in my life commit suicide, a friend and an ex. Both affected me deeply even though one of them I barely spoke to anymore. 
I don't want to hurt the people I love by putting them through that. But I also don't know if I can stay alive for them. Its a handful of friends and family, and generally they don't have a lot of time for me. I'm not berating them for that at all, but staying alive for people that I only talk to/see every now and then is really hard work. I have severe depression, and am alone for maybe 80% of the time. Not for want of trying, they just have busy lives and i dont expect them to make time for me all of the time, I dont doubt that they love me.
So that is the only reason i have for not killing myself. Every day I struggle to find a reason to stay alive and that feeling is just awful. Every day I look up new ways of how to deal with this kind of suffocating depression and none of it works. I would be fully content to end my life if it wasnt for risk of hurting people. But thats a difficult thing to hold on to when every day hurts me so much. 
So i guess I just want to know why I should stay alive against my will. 
FYI I'm not looking for pity or anything like that, I'm genuinely curious to find out some reasons for living a life that I'm done with and opinions on why its OK to tell someone that suicide is not an option when it should be: my life, my body, my decision. 
Stuff like ""it will get better""- thanks but no thanks.
",suicide,"people say that committing suicide is selfish but isn t telling someone not to commit suicide just as selfish?i have been thinking seriously about suicide for a while now the only reason i havent done it, the one reason that i might not, is because i don t want to hurt the people who love me i ve had two people in my life commit suicide, a friend and an ex both affected me deeply even though one of them i barely spoke to anymore  i don t want to hurt the people i love by putting them through that but i also don t know if i can stay alive for them its a handful of friends and family, and generally they don t have a lot of time for me i m not berating them for that at all, but staying alive for people that i only talk to/see every now and then is really hard work i have severe depression, and am alone for maybe 80 of the time not for want of trying, they just have busy lives and i dont expect them to make time for me all of the time, i dont doubt that they love me so that is the only reason i have for not killing myself every day i struggle to find a reason to stay alive and that feeling is just awful every day i look up new ways of how to deal with this kind of suffocating depression and none of it works i would be fully content to end my life if it wasnt for risk of hurting people but thats a difficult thing to hold on to when every day hurts me so much  so i guess i just want to know why i should stay alive against my will  fyi i m not looking for pity or anything like that, i m genuinely curious to find out some reasons for living a life that i m done with and opinions on why its ok to tell someone that suicide is not an option when it should be my life, my body, my decision  stuff like it will get better  thanks but no thanks ",367
5422,"Nobody did anything to me.I’ve spent years trying to track down what exactly my “trauma” is. I wanted to know what caused me to be like this, so I could validate myself. Recently, I’ve come to a conclusion:

Nothing happened. I have no reason to be the sad fuck I am. I’ve lived a picket fence life so far with more than enough, two parents who care as much as they know how to, and a good education. 

My mom called me emotionally abusive. Worse than her bastard father. My sister was shocked and in tears when she heard it, she couldn’t believe my mom would say that considering just how bad her father was. That validated everything I thought about myself for the years leading up to it. In that moment all I could say was “I know.” 

I constantly feel guilty for existing. I feel bad that people have to look at me, talk to me, breathe the same air. I feel guilty for wasting people’s time, and energy. I feel guilty for wasting the ink in my pen that could’ve been used by someone else to write something better. I don’t deserve to fucking breathe. 

How pathetic do I sound? What a fucking spineless idiot. 

It just gets to be too much, watching every action, and replaying every conversation until my head hurts. I have to watch the way I sit, laugh, talk, and monitor how much I tell people. I have to closely watch my tone, and my body language. I have to keep track of what lie I told who. 

It’s exhausting. I’m so fucking tired of it. I can’t do it anymore. I don’t want to do it anymore. 

The frustration of wanting to die, but not wanting to hurt my dad has driven me to the point of taking it out on others with a cutting attitude, and quickness to anger. It’s disgusting and evil, and I hate myself for it. I try to keep myself away from them so that they’re out of the line of fire.

8696,"Lookin for Some AdviceHey so I've been pretty down for as long as I can remember. Always seem to feel out of place unless I'm sitting around by myself. I have several groups of friends which don't interact with eachother in any way, but still I always feel like a loner. There are the typical depressed feelings like being a burden or that somehow in someway things are just better without me, but my family was usually there to disperse those. At the end of last semester I was dismissed from college and had to move home. School is fairly easy for me but I have grown so apathetic that I simply stopped going to class. For whatever reason upon moving home I decided it was a good idea to tell my family that I smoke weed. I tried to explain that it helps me to just get out of my head and let go of my anxieties but they all still treat me like I'm some big drug addict burn out. They may be right although I really dont feel so. Also my girlfriend broke up with me but still works at my families restaurant. I really didnt want the relationship to end and she seems like she doesnt either, I feel like she is scared of me.

11338,"I FINISHED MY DRAMA PERFORMANCE! First post, on mobile if that makes a difference

So due to global situations my school’s Awards Night (where students display artwork and their achievements) was filmed in sections and will be posted online for families to view. The media squad went to different classes to film for the past few weeks.

I was in the senior school drama class and we were given an assignment to be presented during the Awards filming. We had to do a interpretation of the play Hoods. We decided to focus on inter-generational violence and trauma (how it can cycle and repeat).

All through out the week we had been rehearsing whenever we could but on Wednesday we were basically about to give up. We didn’t and we preformed it today after A LOT of stressing. 

Everyone was basically at the end of our ropes (there was 5 of us) and we snapped a few times at each other but we all worked suuuuuuper hard to make it into something we were proud of. We were the last to get filmed, so we had tonnes of practice time and the performance went amazing by my teacher’s opinion.

We only had to do one take of filming (we all thought there would be multiple), we found out later it was because the Media leader thought the first take was good and he was tired from other filming.

It overall we are still riding this adrenaline high and freaking out because we were all so focused on our parts (some of us felt genuine emotions during our scenes like anger &amp; fear) it became a blur. I know we are going to pick apart the performance when we see it on video but our teacher says this was our best performance. Our teacher might be a bit biased but she said “it was the best adaptation on Hoods she had seen.”

I have been smiling since, sorry for slightly bragging but thank you for reading :)

TL:DR - had to preform an adaptation of a play for a filmed school event. We basically were about to give up but we’re encouraged to continue and it went amazing",non-suicide,"i finished my drama performance first post, on mobile if that makes a difference so due to global situations my schools awards night where students display artwork and their achievements was filmed in sections and will be posted online for families to view the media squad went to different classes to film for the past few weeks  i was in the senior school drama class and we were given an assignment to be presented during the awards filming we had to do a interpretation of the play hoods we decided to focus on inter generational violence and trauma how it can cycle and repeat  all through out the week we had been rehearsing whenever we could but on wednesday we were basically about to give up we didnt and we preformed it today after a lot of stressing  everyone was basically at the end of our ropes there was 5 of us and we snapped a few times at each other but we all worked suuuuuuper hard to make it into something we were proud of we were the last to get filmed, so we had tonnes of practice time and the performance went amazing by my teachers opinion  we only had to do one take of filming we all thought there would be multiple , we found out later it was because the media leader thought the first take was good and he was tired from other filming  it overall we are still riding this adrenaline high and freaking out because we were all so focused on our parts some of us felt genuine emotions during our scenes like anger amp fear it became a blur i know we are going to pick apart the performance when we see it on video but our teacher says this was our best performance our teacher might be a bit biased but she said it was the best adaptation on hoods she had seen  i have been smiling since, sorry for slightly bragging but thank you for reading   tl dr  had to preform an adaptation of a play for a filmed school event we basically were about to give up but were encouraged to continue and it went amazing",367
14219,"I've been overcome by these thoughts for too long..I figured when I got my life back on track that they would end. I got the pills, a new job, a new bank (may seem small but it means alot to me), a new girl who cares alot about me (that I'm to afraid to ask out because I don't want to get hurt again), I started hanging out with friends again and ultimately a 'fresh start'. For a time it felt like I was in control again, my doctor even said I was getting better and would slowly be weaned off. 

Even though I'm 10x better than what I was like before I still feel like the world would be better off without me. These feelings aren't out of depression either. I've started to put 'the mask' on making people believe I am better when I'm still struggling. I feel quite weird for still thinking the world would be better off without me. I have enough saved up so I could even pay for my own funeral if I wanted to.

 I even turned to religion looking for a answer, but because of the depression I had before I know everyone's true intentions. I went to a Christian school for most of my life until I graduated a few years ago. I know all about ""god being good"" and such. But it all seems highly fabricated to be (I apologize if that offends anyone, that was not my intent).

TL;DR: I don't know why I'm still feeling this way, I've tried so hard to get better. I broke down most of the walls and am rarely depressed. Yet I still feel like my life isn't worth living even tho it's getting better. I guess you could say I feel 'bored' of living. Like there's no reason I should continue. I know I'd miss out having a family and stuff, but that doesn't bother me.. Only reason I'm still here is because there are people that care about me that I wouldn't want to see sad.

4134,"Just need to get things off of my mind and vent.Okay, I'm trying to be as brief as possible. I'm 17 years old and I've been depressed for three years. Years of PMO (porn, masturbation, and orgasm) have ruined my life. It has caused me health issues, both physically and mentally. The time that PMO took up, I could have used towards better activities. It most likely was a major contributing factor to my depression as well. PMO even led me to get into weird fetishes (which is the case with most PMO people) - eventually incest came into play. Last year I almost committed an incestual act with my own mother, and these experiences keep coming back to haunt me. I'm being haunted by my own past. Keep in mind, I was also on Zoloft last year for my depression. While it did help, it probably led me to committing a stupid and vile act such as that above. Now I'm actively rebooting (basically giving yourself a rest from PMO and artificial stimuli like porn) and I seem to be pretty successful in doing so. I'm just bothered by my past and the fact that I feel like a total loser for the stuff I did in my past. Also, I'm essentially a high school drop out - I'd always had problems attending school, even when I was very young. I'd always hated school for SOME reason. Anyways, right now I'm trying my best to get right with God and accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I repent for all of the stuff that I did in my past and I want to change. But it feels so hard to change when you're really down and depressed. My life went even more downhill right after I weaned off of my anti depressant, but I feel that I HAD to do it.

This has been happening at least once every 2 weeks. Not bad enough to go inpatient, and I don't want to go IOP because they're all online.

I used to have a gun, but I stupidly told my mom where it was. So now my best option is not an option anymore. I had a whole plan and everything. I would go to the park late at night and do it there. It's surrounded by houses far enough that they couldn't see anything (especially in the dark) but close enough to hear gun shot. Only the responding officers would see me and I'd die somewhere that I really enjoyed. I guess I fucked that up.

I have razor blades but I don't want to be in pain at all and I don't like blood. Also, if it backfires, which it probably will because I know I can't do it, I also have low blood sugar so I'd probably just lay on the ground in pain, unable to move, slowly bleeding out.

14095,"Advice needed as soon as possibleI've never told anyone this because I have no one to tell and I'm afraid of being locking up, heavily medicated, embarrassing my family and putting them into debt because anything medical is expensive. I'm in my early thirties and I always have suicide in the back of my mind. I'm a professionally diagnosed highly functioning autistic with ptsd because of abuse, socially anxious, learning disabled, major depressive disorder, treatment resistant and generalized anxiety disorder.  I don't have any children or a significant other. I am divorced and because of this I had to move back in with my parents. I am constantly being told college isn't for me but I feel if I don't at least look into it I will never have a career or be able to live the life I long to live. I held a job for six months as a nursing assistant but couldn't do it anymore because it was very high stress job. I currently work at a gym, watching children who are dropped off by their parents so they can work out. It's low wage $8.00 hr and my hours are not consistent. I'm the oldest person there and I feel horrible about it. One month I will work near full time and the next it will be barely part time. I cannot deal with it anymore. I have been trying to look for another job while I keep this one because little money is better than none at all or having to ask my parents for money which makes me severely depressed even more because they aren't well off and they work very hard. I feel I am nothing but a screw up and everything is hopeless. I don't know what to do. I'm out of ideas. This isn't the life I wanted. I have tried to get disability but I was denied in court because they believe I am too high functioning. 

What are some jobs that pay a livable wage that don't require college that are suitable for introverts and are low stress??",suicide,"advice needed as soon as possiblei ve never told anyone this because i have no one to tell and i m afraid of being locking up, heavily medicated, embarrassing my family and putting them into debt because anything medical is expensive i m in my early thirties and i always have suicide in the back of my mind i m a professionally diagnosed highly functioning autistic with ptsd because of abuse, socially anxious, learning disabled, major depressive disorder, treatment resistant and generalized anxiety disorder  i don t have any children or a significant other i am divorced and because of this i had to move back in with my parents i am constantly being told college isn t for me but i feel if i don t at least look into it i will never have a career or be able to live the life i long to live i held a job for six months as a nursing assistant but couldn t do it anymore because it was very high stress job i currently work at a gym, watching children who are dropped off by their parents so they can work out it s low wage 8 00 hr and my hours are not consistent i m the oldest person there and i feel horrible about it one month i will work near full time and the next it will be barely part time i cannot deal with it anymore i have been trying to look for another job while i keep this one because little money is better than none at all or having to ask my parents for money which makes me severely depressed even more because they aren t well off and they work very hard i feel i am nothing but a screw up and everything is hopeless i don t know what to do i m out of ideas this isn t the life i wanted i have tried to get disability but i was denied in court because they believe i am too high functioning  what are some jobs that pay a livable wage that don t require college that are suitable for introverts and are low stress??",365
14931,"I got really close to killing myself last night for the second time. I just need someone to talk to right now. I feel really alone.I've been suffering from depression since I was in middle school (I'm 21 now). Yesterday I was feeling like shit. Like usual. I got in another tiff with my boyfriend about how I can never open up to him about how I'm feeling. I cry in his bed for like an hour. After I leave instead of going home I drive up a mountain that overlooks my city. I cried alone in my car for four hours. 
I always contemplate suicide. Yesterday I decided I would finally do it. I started  driving to the Golden Gate Bridge (I live about an hour away from it). On the way to San Francisco I realized that my method was ridiculous because I'm horribly afraid of heights. Also I can't kill myself right now because I take care of these dogs and the family that owns them is going out of the country for a few months in a few weeks. If I died they wouldn't have anyone to walk their pugs.(yeah I'm 21 years old and I have a job as a dog walker because I'm too scared to get a real job. I'm such a loser) I love those dogs. And they unconditionally love me. It's kind of a lame reason, I know. 
Anyway, I don't really have any friends. I never really made new friends at college. I don't talk with my old friends from high school. I can't talk with my boyfriend about my depression because it's too difficult. He always blames himself or gets frustrated and I just can't deal with him. Every time we talk about my depression he honestly just makes me feel worse. I never even told him about the last time I tried to commit suicide. I had a rope in my car and I was planning on going to the park... 
I feel so, so alone. I really could use someone to talk to right now.",suicide,"i got really close to killing myself last night for the second time i just need someone to talk to right now i feel really alone i ve been suffering from depression since i was in middle school i m 21 now  yesterday i was feeling like shit like usual i got in another tiff with my boyfriend about how i can never open up to him about how i m feeling i cry in his bed for like an hour after i leave instead of going home i drive up a mountain that overlooks my city i cried alone in my car for four hours  i always contemplate suicide yesterday i decided i would finally do it i started driving to the golden gate bridge i live about an hour away from it  on the way to san francisco i realized that my method was ridiculous because i m horribly afraid of heights also i can t kill myself right now because i take care of these dogs and the family that owns them is going out of the country for a few months in a few weeks if i died they wouldn t have anyone to walk their pugs yeah i m 21 years old and i have a job as a dog walker because i m too scared to get a real job i m such a loser i love those dogs and they unconditionally love me it s kind of a lame reason, i know  anyway, i don t really have any friends i never really made new friends at college i don t talk with my old friends from high school i can t talk with my boyfriend about my depression because it s too difficult he always blames himself or gets frustrated and i just can t deal with him every time we talk about my depression he honestly just makes me feel worse i never even told him about the last time i tried to commit suicide i had a rope in my car and i was planning on going to the park   i feel so, so alone i really could use someone to talk to right now ",365

6662,"I'm NEVER good enough for my parentsI'm 16 and live in New Zealand. I spend a lot of my time on the computer on the internet. Living with family but have no contact with them, I only go out sometimes to see friends. I am generally a shy person.

Every conversation I have they'll subtly suggest I'm a loser. The questions they ask, the way they word things. My emotions just sometimes absolutely jump. They complain that I can't have a nice conversation with them, WELL MAYBE STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW PATHETIC YOU THINK I AM. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. I had to have several goes at typing that because I had a spasm of anger.

They don't realise I have their email passwords and can see the hurtful things they email other family members about me. It hurts more than their subtle questions, and is obviously a more honest approach.

I am often described socially awkward and they don't realise how much it hurts me. So many who are themselves hating judgement will quickly say it, and inside I will crush. Also weird. Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo. Parents tried forcing me to drop out of high school because I was 'different'. I don't see what's so bad about me.

I have little friends and have much trouble making any. When I do something productive or organise something everyone will hate it. It really hurts, I'm not trying to do a competition with other people. I just want to do my own thing. I've organised events which have been in the paper, a music website and a successful Minecraft server. All to receive negative comments from friends and people I know eager for me stop, eventually causing me to with no motivation to do anything else with myself. How nice.

Really, right now I just need a genuine opinion that my life will be good. I could see myself just ending my life off. My life consists of school, then locking myself in the bedroom.

I had always had nightmare about losing her and one day... she went to the ICU wish I could’ve actually said bye... my last words with her were goodnight. After that happened I started having dreams of her doing what we usually did on weekends I.e. cooking, watching tv, etc. I eventually moved on 
from that with the help of my friends and family.

I mean it’s kinda bad, but I can move on. I move on to online school, that ends without a hitch. Then i meet this girl who I have a class with via social media and we start talking- a lot actually until after 3 months of back and forth, I get ghosted, I finally say after a week a ghosting to tell her my true feelings. I get “ok lol” and yeah I’m not the best looking or smartest person ever so I respect her decision and move on. But it really hit me hard. A month later my bearded dragon which I’ve had since 2nd grade is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. This is basically where I am now. I’m taking the best care I can of my beardie making sure he is comfortable. A lot of time i just think to myself if there’s ever anyone watching out for me if I’m worth anything. I’ve always been overweight so I’ve started to work out and that is a big stress reliever and thing have gotten a little better but... I need advice on how I can improve myself... to be more likable.

Maybe I'm ugly, maybe he's just turned off by me, maybe maybe maybe. He would always say he didnt know why he just wouldnt make a move. I was always the one to do it first. 

Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 

Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.

So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

But I just feel so empty. I keep picturing myself slitting my wrist in the tub like a bad movie, or just overdosing on pills. I keep seeing myself running into traffic or driving off the side of the road. Maybe I dont have the guts idk. I just want this to be over. This pain isnt fun. Trying to catch my breath. Beating my head like it's an old television and I'm trying to get good reception, just hoping I can fix it...

To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...

Tonight feels right but i’m still confused &amp; frustrated... after months of fantasising about my death and making preparations more than once i want to get a few things in order and end it tonight yet i feel as if i still need closure.... 

i’m not sure if im feeling this because i’ve always believed it’s an act of weakness. i’ve always had a strong will, &amp; mental fortitude... i’m emotionally thick skinned, Always seeking to listen, advise / support others without feeling burdened or troubled by it yet all i can think of is dying the last few months since breaking up with my gf.

I loved her, accepted her as my family and would of given my life for her yet she wont even say goodbye... since we broke up i spent the last few Months not sleeping more than a couple hrs a night when I only sleep through sheer exhaustion &amp; even then i am disturbed by whatever paranormal presences is in this apartment. I have no energy left after spending hours at work pretending to be okay and helping others.
I have no desire to live anymore.

since me and my gf broke up we can’t speak as she doesn’t reply to me which i may be why i’m confused about my decision. i want her to acknowledge my thoughts / feelings, that way i can find closure in our time together. Without this i feel i’ll be ending everything prematurely and this leaves me unsettled. I plan to go out as comfortably as possible but this just deprives me of a peaceful end and i really wish to die knowing my thoughts are as clear as possible.

I'm a burden to everyone.  I have a good job and I hate it.  I have a husband who loves me.  Still, every night I weigh the option of killing myself vs dragging my ass through one more day.  There is a weight on my shoulders that's so heavy I can feel it in my stride when I walk.  I have dreams every night that I can't stand up straight, I walk bent over unable to see where I'm going.

I've talked to a doctor, been put on pills, they don't work.  

I wait until the husband sleeps and I stay up crying most of the night

Friends and family would rather cry about what they should have done at your funeral than deal with you while you're alive.  Not that I can bother staying in touch with any of them.  It is exhausting even responding to a text.

I keep praying to a god I'm not sure I even believe in.......the silence in reply is a slap to the face.

So what do you do when you feel worthless, have no clue who to talk to..(suicide hotline is useless, they read off a script and won't actually talk to you).  This box just keeps getting smaller.  There's a constant screaming in my head to end it.  I can't look at my wrists without wanting to slice them wide open, or get a new prescription without looking up how many of the pills it would take to kill me.  Not that I would try either of those, I'd opt for a less painful experience.

I don't have that feeling of relief yet that people talk about, once they decide to actually do it, so I guess that means I'm not quite there.  If I was I suppose I wouldn't bother posting here at all.

I'm 15 years old, life is fucking bullshit, things get better? No they fucking don't.
If I had a gun I would've already done it, I'm just too much of a fucking coward to cut my wrist or hang from the ceiling, a gun shot is much faster and less painful.
So, a backstory of my really optimistic, fun, beautiful life, sarcasm alert if not obvious enough.
I'm 15, dad doesn't live in the house, but that doesn't affect me, atleast I don't hear endless abuse and screaming now, that's a plus.
My mom gives around 1.5/10 shits which is really low on the shit giving scale (basically she doesn't give a fuck about how I feel).
School been going downhill ever since 9th grade when I realized I'm not into academics and just wasting my time which makes me more depressed if all is not enough.
Mom pressures me into studying which makes more anxious and depressed.
I think about suicide on hourly basis, actually that's a fucking joke... it's always on my mind not just hourly.
It's summer break now and I was supposed to work and pursue my hobby, but HAHAHA who the fuck would employ a failure, so now I can't pursue a hobby that I can enjoy when I get back to school, which makes me more depressed because I got nothing to do when school aka prison is back.


Oh but I don't have to worry... things get better, right? No that's the biggest lie I have ever been told. Things get better only when I die or get out of school which is in 2 years; impossible to survive.
There is absolutely no point in living, I wish I have a gun so I can shoot myself and be done with it.

6517,"I went out for my final walk the other nightFirst of all, apologies for the extremely lengthy post.

I'm 27 years old, not that it should matter, mental health is an issue at any age. I have no friends to confide in and my family is broken and the ones that listen don't offer great advice.

5 years ago I tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge, I fell about 200 ft, hit water and was instantly knocked unconscious. I woke up in hospital the next morning, surrounded by doctors and my girlfriend from the time.

I've had a rough past, all kinds of abuse, sexual, physical, mental, alcohol and drugs.

The tipping point for that episode 5 years ago was when I fell in love with said girlfriend at the time (Who, actually, wasn't _quite_ my girlfriend yet.) and caught her with her 'ex'. We were a thing at the time but hadn't made anything official.

Small things like that have been known to have a massive effect on me.

Well /r/SuicideWatch, I would like to say I'm an enlightened man. But unfortunately I left that woman 5 months ago. Things weren't working and we weren't happy anymore. But rather than try to fix it, I ran away. 

Over the past few weeks, I've began to miss ""Christine"" (name changed for anonymity), really, very badly.

I found out that she has a new boyfriend with whom she is happy, on the 28th of November.

I went out for my final walk.

Unfortunately, though I had planned to jump from a bridge, I neglected to think about which one, and as it turns out, there are 5 or 6 within a 4 square-mile radius of my home. None of them are high enough.

And so I'm sat again. 3 words revolving around my head, over and over. Except now I'm thinking of various other methods.

The point of my post wasn't so that people would read it. I know people will. And I know most people will probably try to console me.

8275,"My life in this 'story'Keep in mind I am in 8th grade.

There once was a man named Steve. Steve was not like the others. Steve was the person who was a social outcast. Since elementary school up to this point he had thought friends and life was going to be a smooth sail onto his ending days. As it had seemed a storm was brewing nearby that ship and had messed up the course of direction.
     This was Steve's description of 8th grade. The year were he had no friends, nor anyone to talk to, or anyone to care. Steve had always thought those past years life was going to maintain that smooth sail. but as all good things come to an end, that sail had.
     Because of his lack of friends, social skills, and abundance of depression he never seemed to be happy with how life has occurred those past 7 months in school.
     Those 7 months were a living hell for Steve. He had lost many things that were dear to him during that time. He had let his anger control him, which would result in him thinking of how he could of done better. Everyday he thinks of that thought he doesn't understand why he hasn't ended it all yet. Why he killed himself.
     Most people would forget in a week or so anyways as it would seem. So that's what he was going to do. This year in 2015 Steve was going to commit to at least one thing in his life and do this.
     It seemed during this time of distress he had forgotten what was most dear to him, his only friend. He had done exactly what he had done with his anger. Forgotten his surroundings and had already said he would do it.
     This failure would result in Steve becoming more depressed than he was in earlier months. Thinking of ending it all the being reminded of the one string that connected him to be his own self.

The 'one string' is a metaphor for my only friend. I seem to be losing touch with her however. :(",suicide,"my life in this story keep in mind i am in 8th grade  there once was a man named steve steve was not like the others steve was the person who was a social outcast since elementary school up to this point he had thought friends and life was going to be a smooth sail onto his ending days as it had seemed a storm was brewing nearby that ship and had messed up the course of direction    this was steve s description of 8th grade the year were he had no friends, nor anyone to talk to, or anyone to care steve had always thought those past years life was going to maintain that smooth sail but as all good things come to an end, that sail had    because of his lack of friends, social skills, and abundance of depression he never seemed to be happy with how life has occurred those past 7 months in school    those 7 months were a living hell for steve he had lost many things that were dear to him during that time he had let his anger control him, which would result in him thinking of how he could of done better everyday he thinks of that thought he doesn t understand why he hasn t ended it all yet why he killed himself    most people would forget in a week or so anyways as it would seem so that s what he was going to do this year in 2015 steve was going to commit to at least one thing in his life and do this    it seemed during this time of distress he had forgotten what was most dear to him, his only friend he had done exactly what he had done with his anger forgotten his surroundings and had already said he would do it    this failure would result in steve becoming more depressed than he was in earlier months thinking of ending it all the being reminded of the one string that connected him to be his own self  the one string is a metaphor for my only friend i seem to be losing touch with her however  ",360

My only reprieve was feeling I could confide in a particular person who had seemed so understanding before. I told him that I'd lost all my friends because they couldn't deal with it anymore. I ended up having a meltdown at work, and freaked him out by talking about how I felt useless and toxic. That I was sorry I'm like this and sorry he had to know me.

The weekend came and I felt so broken. I couldn't stop crying. I self harmed to try and find some distraction. And I turned to him because I had no one left. His response was 'I'm in bed. can you not', I made great mistake of continuing. And he blocked me. Told me I was freaking him out. 'seriously stop. I can't be your cry for help' and blocked me on everything possible.

Told me he was always going to unblock me, that he just didn't want me to freak out, that he'd give me another shot... That he'd unblock me later that night because he was just in the middle of something. I was an idiot to think he would...

125,"No matter how many times “it gets better”, I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and I’m ready to lie in it.I’m 26 now, have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my 12 year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment. It’s gotten better, but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time. The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead, mourning me and my choices, is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations. Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. I’m actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I don’t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and I’m getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but I’m wondering who’s battle is this actually? I’m definitely not fighting for myself anymore.

My life is static due to an early life crisis. See I had always known I wanted to be a writer since childhood. It was all I ever saw myself doing. When I was in the 12th grade I entered in an essay contest and I overheard the head of the contest talking about my essay. His words were "" this is why he will never be a good writer"" as he said it we made eye contact. I was lost for words and in the moment pretended I didn't hear anything. The next day I was more depressed than I had ever been. I lost faith in my skill and my dream. I couldn't even muster the strength to go to school. 3 years later I'm a drop out with no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm angry at everyone and everything. I try to write and I'm not happy with anything I come up with. Everyone in my life thinks I graduated and am working on getting into community college classes and that I want to be a filmmaker. I have tried to make short films but they are all shit and unwatchable. The truth is that I walk around pretending to be homeless and sleep on park benchs.  I tried to off myself because I truly think I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this, but at the moment of truth I realised I didn't really want to die. The problem now is that I don't know what to do. I can't go back to school, I can't write with confidence, and my films are trash. Its also too late to tell my friends the truth without losing them.

I found this page not long ago but as I’m reading through all these posts and after being around other suicidal people I feel ashamed. From an outside perspective I don’t have anything particularly wrong with my life. I have friends, family, a significant other, my grades are decent. Despite all this I keep thinking about killing myself constantly.

I keep telling myself that I’m too much of a pussy to go through with it but lately I’ve had an extremely strong urge to take the shotgun in my house, go out into the woods, and end my blight on the world.

I feel like I don’t deserve to get help or go to a psychiatrist because I don’t want to waste resources or that my feelings are invalid since I haven’t actually attempted anything or that since all of it’s in my head that it must be my fault and that I’m just an attention whore for thinking about myself all the time. 

All of my problems stem from the things I think about myself which makes me feel the most guilty. I know everything stems from my head and I feel like I’m just making all of it up for attention and because of that I deserve to kill myself for wasting everybody’s time and resources. It’s all irrational and contradicting since I’ve only told two people about this stuff.

I know I’m probably going to piss people off by posting here when I don’t deserve to but I don’t know where else to go.

14843,"I'm too stupid to achieve anything in life. I'm thinking of taking my life tomorrow night.I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

 I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse.

The first time he did it, I got really startled, and when I checked discord, the message was gone. So I thought it would be okay to ignore it. Then he kept doing it over a span of a few weeks....and finally, I just confronted him because I just couldn’t take it anymore, I felt nervous, sad, and confused.

I feel so bad right now, because he was a close friend of mine from middle school...and to tell the truth, I did know that he liked me for a long time now, I just never thought I would have to deal with it this way...and as bad as I feel, I unfortunately can’t return the feelings back to him.

To top it all off, I think he has anxiety/depression. I’ve had several deep conversations with him, trying to help him feel better because he’s my friend. He has told me that people have thought of him as annoying, and he is often insecure about himself. He also feels that people don’t like him, and he doesn’t have many friends. And I just don’t know what to do to lessen the blow of this situation on because I don’t want to hurt him. 

What do I do? I’m really nervous. He has not responded yet. I think he’s seen the messages, but hasn’t said anything.

I want to be stern about him sending and deleting these messages, but at the same time, I don’t want him to feel as bad knowing I only see him as a good friend.

The world just doesn't make sense anymore.

It's very discouraging that I keep getting declined to get a job, but even more so when I keep on having to disappoint others with the bad news, especially when they expect a lot from me. This has affected my relationships with family, friends, girlfriend, etc.

All it takes is one YES to change my own world, but even then, I can't get that. Forget about paying debts or expenses; I'm just trying to make the rent and have food to bring home AT THE BARE MINIMUM and even that I cannot do!

This constant rejection is seriously dwindling my confidence like never before. They say that if you have a roof over your head, food on the table, and family who loves you that you are richer than most of the people on Earth, but I beg to differ. That just sounds a little cliche if you ask me.

I'm just going downward on this slippery slope: I have no car, no job, and apparently, no future. Even the place that was supposed to help me with employment and get proper attire for interviews had my case worker retired and no responses from my referral either. Murphy's law is a serious bitch!

I seriously would like to stay optimistic, but I would be bullshiting myself and those who I come in contact with. I have no use pretending that everything is fine just for someone elses benefit.

11484,"My sister told me that this is her last week, and I don't know what to do.Hi I'm new to this and I am seeking help for my little sister who is going through a really rough time, and I'm starting to think she may want to end it.

For a long time now my sister (who is still in high school) has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a month ago. It was clear for a lot longer time that something was wrong, but now we just have a name put to it. 

Her depression wasn't as bad as it was about a couple months ago, but it is quickly escalating. There is no particular source I believe to her depression, and she is really close to me so if there were something she would tell me. She tells me a lot that her life at home is a bit rough, but from what I've seen the conditions aren't terrible, her father is just sometimes rude. Recently she had been talking of suicide. She told me that she has found easy methods of killing herself, and that this might be her last week. I always tell her things like ""We all need you, and love you"" or ""The world would be so different without you"" and ""Without you I'd be nothing"" but I can never convince her. 

I have never been so scared, I am worried about her safety and would do anything for her to get better. I don't know how to talk to or how delicate I should be to people who have depression. Is there something I can do as an individual to help her? 

Some extra info; she has been using ProZac for a little under a month, she says it helps but clearly she is still having active thoughts of suicide, so I'm not so sure. She has an appointment with a therapist in March I believe, but I don't know how much time she has left.

I've been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember. It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess. I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework. Since I've started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life. My dorm room was covered with post-it notes and reminders on my walls, I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework. I've been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress. At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown.

I went to see my doctor about the problems i've been having, he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist. I'm now on a six month waiting list. I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I'm afraid of disappointing them. They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life. I feel like this is beyond my control now. I've wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees. I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them. I feel the only way forward is to end my own life. By the time I get to see a psychiatrist it will be too late, and even if i do get 'help' sooner I doubt it will change much about myself. 

This is my third time re-writing this, so i hope I got my message across clearly. I'm sorry for not being more specific about everything. If I try explain things I start rambling and don't get a point across.

7598,"Appreciation post.One year ago, I was on one of the worst phases in my life, I felt like nobody gave a shit about me, all my life collapsed, people told me that it's all temporary but I didn't believe them since the past 2 years felt like forever, I tried to end my life 2 times thank god I failed, I used to spend my whole day laying in my bed overthinking shit that happened years ago and I'm pretty sure no one remembers it. When I asked my parents to take me to a therapist they refused and called me crazy.

When I discovered this subreddit every post was relatable, I kept reading how people feel and the comments kinda made sense,for the first time in my life I felt like someone actually cares if I'm alive, even when the comments weren't directed to me. I actually wrote a post here and it got ignored so I just deleted it lol.

I made a decision to take some advices from your comments and try them out since I have nothing to do, I started working out, I tried getting back to my hobbies ( making shitty software ), I left myself do whatever I want, I wanna scream ? Do it, wanna cry ? Do it, wanna play a game ? Do it, wanna go outside ? Do it ( not currently bois ).

Now after a year from this, I actually feel better than before, I still overthink sometimes but totally less than before, no more suicidal thoughts, I can live with my mistakes now, and it's all because of you everybody, I want to thank every single person who gave some of his time to write a comment on this subreddit for the sake of helping people he doesn't know.

And for everyone who's going though shit in his life, take it from me, I know how bad it is and how it feels like it will never be over, but it will, ik it' sounds cliché but it's the truth, I love you random citizen ♥️",suicide,"appreciation post one year ago, i was on one of the worst phases in my life, i felt like nobody gave a shit about me, all my life collapsed, people told me that it s all temporary but i didn t believe them since the past 2 years felt like forever, i tried to end my life 2 times thank god i failed, i used to spend my whole day laying in my bed overthinking shit that happened years ago and i m pretty sure no one remembers it when i asked my parents to take me to a therapist they refused and called me crazy  when i discovered this subreddit every post was relatable, i kept reading how people feel and the comments kinda made sense,for the first time in my life i felt like someone actually cares if i m alive, even when the comments weren t directed to me i actually wrote a post here and it got ignored so i just deleted it lol  i made a decision to take some advices from your comments and try them out since i have nothing to do, i started working out, i tried getting back to my hobbies  making shitty software , i left myself do whatever i want, i wanna scream ? do it, wanna cry ? do it, wanna play a game ? do it, wanna go outside ? do it  not currently bois   now after a year from this, i actually feel better than before, i still overthink sometimes but totally less than before, no more suicidal thoughts, i can live with my mistakes now, and it s all because of you everybody, i want to thank every single person who gave some of his time to write a comment on this subreddit for the sake of helping people he doesn t know  and for everyone who s going though shit in his life, take it from me, i know how bad it is and how it feels like it will never be over, but it will, ik it sounds clich but it s the truth, i love you random citizen ",356
15549,"Need some help, been in a really dark place lately.So about a month ago at this point, my parents discovered the text messages between me and my boyfriend, the issue with this is that they didn't know I had a boyfriend... To say they were upset would be a massive understatement. 

They are very strong Christians and me being gay goes against what they believe. Now don't get me wrong I am a strong believer myself, however the details of what I believe to be true about the Lord and such differs slightly from what they believe. 

As a reaction to the situation they took away my phone, car keys, any and all video games that I had, and all WiFi access. They even completely blocked communication between him and I. I understand that they paid for roughly 80% of everything they took, but it still seems like a huge overreaction. Since then I've only gotten back the ability to simply listen to music, and it doesn't seem like I'll be getting anything else back anytime soon. I have no communication with any of my friends and I feel like I'm being held hostage. I have nowhere to look and nobody that I trust to turn too.

I've just been really depressed and so bored that I've literally spent hours staring at my wall from time to time. I feel like I have no escape, I know that suicide is an awful thing, and I don't want to go down the same path I went through about 4 months ago. All I'm looking for is some advice and some encouraging words or something. I just feel like I've deeply embarrassed and disappointed my parents. They've told me multiple times already that they aren't disappointed, but it seems hard to believe considering what they're putting me through. I'm honestly just lost and confused because of all of this, and I'm really scared..

I'm mad at myself and too tired to move. I want to skip work but staying home is worse because everyone here treats me like I'm toxic just for existing, and tries to convince me I'm bad and awful for expecting them to meet me even just a third of the way. It's so hard to fight back without becoming a nasty person too, and I feel like I'd rather just hang than work hard to own myself again. 

I'm so mad at myself that I got myself into such an awful situation, and I'm broken hearted that no one else I the apt will even try to get his resolved, so I'm going to have to get my roommates evicted or something instead of kindly letting them or me leave.

My hand is infected from trying to protect cats, and the antibiotics aren't working, and I can't find my cream and that makes me paranoid about all of this. 

Every time  I try to sleep I say I want to die. I want to break myself to pieces and die. I haven't slept more than 4 hours in days, and work is in four hours again. I feel like vomiting. 

I can't go to work, and I can't be safe in my house, so the best  option is death.

I know it is not but it is the only other option that gives me rest. 
I just hate it and everything is my fault, and I'm probably being terrible and selfish for wanting my home to be better for me and my cat. I only am alive for him so he won't eat me by accident.  I don't know how to take care of me anymore, I'm so trapped and I'm so scared to push.

My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever.

This excuses maxing out my card, his card, spending every dime including change from penny jar, getting deposits back at the beer store - it's always the last night so do your worst, right?

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of ""medical leave"" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys. He drinks until his head bobs around, until he stumbles and breaks things and 100% denies he's drunk. 

I never should have gone to university. I never should have left that shithole town. I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth. I hate my life. I hate every day I wake up. 

I hate myself for not doing it already. I've cut my arms open but never deep enough. I hung myself but not privately enough. I've overdosed but barfed most of it up.

4428,"Think this is itGuess I’ll just introduce myself first


My name’s Daniel. I’m turning seventeen this year. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety (both diagnosed) since I was 13. I’ve had 4 therapists, none of them helped. I grew up in a nice house in the countryside with a good family, good income, etc. Started self harming and starving at 13/14. I used to be the smart kid when I was younger but now I’m just a fucking idiot. I failed exams last year and I’m scared I’ve failed all of them this year. I have no talents and no hobbies besides writing stupid stories. I feel like all my friends really hate me and see me as an embarrassment to be around. 

I’m hideous and fat and ugly and ridiculously short for a guy. I’ve had one relationship. I think I fucked up a friendship with my close friend the other night because I got way too drunk and I’m terrified I said some shit or was an embarrassment but I can’t even remember half the night. I don’t know what to do with my life in the future, and I never have. I have an older brother who’s studying law and graduating and he’s the perfect son. I only feel good when I’m drunk but have breakdowns and severe anxiety once I’m sober again. My teachers hate me and they all have even since I was young. I’ve never done anything good in my life or done anything to make anyone proud. I’m annoying, ugly, lazy, embarrassing, hopeless and a waste of a life. 

I think I’m just coming to my end. I’m drinking more and at this rate I’m just gonna hit up the junkies at school and do whatever I can get my hands on. I’m a disappointment of a child and I hate that my family actually cares.

Counseling hasn't helped.  
Talking with friends and family hasn't helped.  
Being alone **definitely** hasn't helped.  
I don't really want to take pills to function or use anti-depressants. My sister has been waiting for a reason to 5150 me, and frankly, maybe that's what I want. Being forced into therapy and medication I don't want. Housed in a place I can sob and just exist because I really don't want to do anything else for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I don't know the costs of being in such a fine institution for the rest of my life, and I don't want to burden my family with that. In my mind, once my wife's heart stopped, my time stopped too. So I just feel like I'm floating around in this stressful wasteland just trying to exist, but life wants me to be a functional part of society already and be *responsible* with the life that I have. In my mind, I no longer have a life and am just living on borrowed time because I literally do not want to do anything because everything reminds me of what I used to have with my wife. I've researched and even contemplated if I should just learn the DNM bible and trying my luck with all that. One of my more understanding friends said maybe a goal for me is to save and get to Switzerland for the assisted suicide thing. I wish this was more available in the US. I'm just thankful the a very select amount of friends understand how much pain I am going through and that I do not want to be here anymore.

4279,Need help. Getting depressed about thinking about the pastMy wife and I met in high school our sophomore year. It was great until senior year. I broke it up with her senior year because I wanted to hang out with my friends more and I felt like she was too clingy. We started talking again a little after high school. But we were in the friend's stage. She would go out with some guys just to make me jealous (she told me this later). And we got back together before she could get in a committed relationship. So fast forward seven years to the present we been married and we just talking about old times and talking about high school and she tells me that she indeed slept with a friend of mine while we were broken up. To me I'm shocked and now I just can't stop picturing it in my mind of the image of those two having sex. Since we dated so young I never had really never had sex with anyone else except her( very embarrassing to say but I want you to get where I'm coming from. So to me sex is something that is special) and now everyday I just picture what they could have done like all the positions and stuff and all the stuff before sex. She says it didn't mean anything and she was trying to make me jealous at the time but felt bad after so thats why she never told me. I know she didn't do anything wrong because we were broken up but now when I see her or at work thats all I can imagine. Am I insane and making too much of it? she hates talking about it so it's hard just to tell her how I feel but I just picture them so vividly. It been getting me depressed and been seeing a doctor about it but still that doesn't help. So i don't know what else to do. How do i stop picturing it?

6064,"How can I get over the past?When I was around 11 or 12 I'd not long had our puppy. I heard our puppy was going to be stolen. I was so scared and upset at the thought of this happening. So I begged my mum to let the puppy sleep on my bed for the night. My mum wouldn't usually allow this because she thought it was unhygienic. But that night she she allowed it because she knew how scared I was. I just wanted to keep our dog safe! 
So I was laying in about about to fall asleep, then my dog started to lick my privates. I thought it felt nice but was confused why it felt like that. Since I was only 11 or 12. I didn't think anything of it. 
I liked the feeling of it, although I'm not attracted to animals in any way.
I let my dog do this a few times, I only remember it happening three times, but it could've happened more. I don't know. It stopped at about the age of 14 because I started to realised how wrong it was. But it didn't upset me, I just never let it happen again and got on with my life.
And now about 8 years later it's really started to affect me. I can't stop thinking about this, and why id even allow it to happen. I feel so sick to my stomach when I think about it. And feel so guilty and shameful. If I could go back in time and change this, I would. I feel like a monster. 
I have a partner who I have a child with. My partner knows about this, I told him a few weeks ago, and he doesn't think it's a big deal. He doesn't judge me. He said I was just a kid and kids so stupid things.

There are thousands of gods that people believe in with all their heart. If the only way that you can obtain heaven is through the word of others, how can you ever be sure that you're picking the right one?


The truth is, everyone is more likely to pick the God that they were first introduced too. Whether it be Allah, Shiva, Buddha, Brahma, Ganesha, etc... None of them depend on proof. They're all based on a book and the belief of others. If for some reason I created my own Bible and my own God, I have the chance to influence the belief of everyone around me and create my own religion (it's been done - - see Latter-day Saints).


The only God I would ever believe in is one that provides proof on it's own and doesn't depend on other humans to spread his word. 


Theists always say that they have experienced a miracle and that's why they believe, but without that introduction of a God via someone else then it would remain just that - - an unexplained scientific miracle. 


Humans are objectively unreliable. We see things that aren't there. Our brains can trick us into believing ANYTHING by misfiring some neurons. Our thoughts and actions are almost completely dependent on the expirences we had growing up. Why would an all powerful and all-loving God damn us to hell for not trusting the word of others? 


If he wants to be worshipped and the only way to send us to heaven is to worship him, SHOW PROOF. I guarantee every single human on earth would get on their knees. It seems like what these gods really want is for us to be able to be indoctrinated by other humans, and that is morally questionable, and just goes completely against the idea of free will and human's instinct to avoid being held down by chains.

He's had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, but at least back then I could go to his place and hold him or if we weren't together I could, I don't know, call his parents or something.

I don't know what to do now. He's currently living with some family friends, but I've never met them. I don't know his new address. Part of me is starting to think that if living is so evidently painful for him, am I even in the right to stop him?

I feel like I'm doing this so wrong, trying to get him to see that his beliefs about himself are completely misguided and make no sense. But I'm deathly scared that if he doesn't have someone in his life to get him out of that cycle of thoughts, it's only going to get worse. I desperately just want him to at least try therapy.

He called a psychological counselling call-line type of thing, and when he told them that he doesn't really see a purpose in his life anymore the woman told him it's just a ""teenage"" issue. I went from being thrilled that he's trying to get help, to wanting to push a call centre employee off a bridge. He, on the other hand, was more or less unfazed. He insists that therapy would never help him.

His suicidal comments get more serious every time we talk about it. I feel cold sweat gathering on my back when he logs off after having a conversation.

7182,"Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future? Pedophilia is not something new, we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it. 

However, in the recent past weeks, a large number of social media accounts, news articles, and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so-called MAPS (self-identified maps) aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get ""along"" with LGBtQ+ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves.

Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape. I was sickened and was worried . 

In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as ""unnatural"".I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case, it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles.

Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai (Japanese pornographic art) labeled as loli available at one click away.

Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it.

I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel.

https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k7d06x/im_getting_a_restraining_order/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

Sadly, the judge denied our petition to get a restraining order.

My guess? Aside from gender, race &amp;amp; and age biases...

My Mom stalled for a LONG time. This should’ve been done immediately, instead my Mom purposefully kept putting it off. She promised this back in June - 6 months ago. I only finally convinced her last month. We filed for the petition last week, and the most recent major incident we could 100% prove was 5 months ago. There’s been events since then of course, but not easy to prove it’s her.

**But then... a miracle happened.**

My mom realized one of our neighbors is military.

She talked to him.

Turns out he was stationed at the EXACT same base that she’s at right now. We forwarded them the document I have compiled, and him and his wife were able to take it straight to her commander. The FULL version. 37 complete pages of everything I’ve saved since 2017.

And today our neighbor informed my mom that my stalker has officially been issued a [No-Contact Order](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-protective-restraining-orders-3354203) by her commander.

Definition:

“No contact orders are like the restraining order in the civilian world. These orders are issued to protect the safety of another person or of several people. It could be issued if a person in authority suspects inappropriate actions by someone in their command.”

This means... I am free. Finally. I’m 19, and the person who’s forced herself to be the focal point of my life since I was 14 is finally gone.

14994,"it never gets better(first reddit post, wow thats sad but whatever) its 4 am and idk who else to talk to.

 This might be a shout into the void but whatever. so ive been suicidal with severe depression and anxiety for about 6 years now. i’m almost 19, and until a year ago i kept telling myself, “wait until you graduate, everything will get better”. Well, here I am, and now I feel things have only gotten worse. Each new positive aspect gained brings along 2 negative ones. I live with my girlfriend of almost 4 years, awesome. But now i have to pay rent and we’re both struggling and no one to clean up after us so everything just gets disgusting and makes us feel worse. I can drive, sweet. Now I get to pay $200 a month for insurance on top of gas, plus all my close friends moved out of state because living here is impossible. I’m going to school for what I want to do, or so I thought. I’m in beauty school, i loved makeup before but now the depression has ruined that too. and my social anxiety makes it almost impossible to work on clients or even talk to my classmates without being a wreck, i so badly want to drop out but i can’t afford to start paying my loans, plus then everyone would be disappointed in me and i would stop getting money i need from my family in order to live. I just feel like every breath I take costs some amount of money and I want to stop paying. And if it isnt obvious i can’t afford therapy, i have my state’s low income insurance but even then finding someone who will accept new patients who isn’t a stupid long drive away is near impossible. my friends dont talk to me anymore and i fail every time i try to make new ones, in person or online. idk, it just feels like i’ve dug myself into a hole i’ll never get out of and i’m ready to take the easy way out.

4751,"(17) Please tell me it gets better after high school. I have a rope sitting in my Amazon cart.I've suffered from this long enough to know that suicidal thoughts are fleeting.

Yet, they keep coming back. Too often. I tell myself that I've grown stronger since then, but the events in my life seem to be worsening. In the past 7 days, I got rejected from a full-ride scholarship that would allow me to pursue my educational dreams. I poured my heart and soul into that application, only to find out that even beyond my stats, my story and hard work just weren't good enough. I also found out that my ex cheated on me for an entire year; they're all laughing at me on social media now. My grades are declining. Straight A student for 11 years...now a chronic C student. 

I find myself, once again, curled up in the corner of my room drenching my t-shirt in tears and snot. 

My mind is currently consumed with the thoughts of, ""What did I do wrong? What am I worth? Am I too ugly, just like I had always thought? Why did I not connect the yeast infections and UTIs to my partner's disloyalty? Can I trust anyone anymore? How will I go into my next relationship without insecurities?"" 

I've reached out to so many caring friends, but I know I'm burdening them with my issues. Seeking professional help is not an option at the moment, as my parents believe that mental health issues do not exist. They are genocide survivors, and they'd tell me, ""How can you be so frail while living a cushioned life?"" I feel guilty. Disappointed. Numb. Confused. Selfish.

But most of all, I am tired. I need a long, long rest. I recently read a post somewhere about how sleep is just a free trial of death. Sounds good to me. 

I pride myself on developing my own coping mechanisms, but are they really working if I continue to revisit that corner in my room?",suicide," 17 please tell me it gets better after high school i have a rope sitting in my amazon cart i ve suffered from this long enough to know that suicidal thoughts are fleeting  yet, they keep coming back too often i tell myself that i ve grown stronger since then, but the events in my life seem to be worsening in the past 7 days, i got rejected from a full ride scholarship that would allow me to pursue my educational dreams i poured my heart and soul into that application, only to find out that even beyond my stats, my story and hard work just weren t good enough i also found out that my ex cheated on me for an entire year they re all laughing at me on social media now my grades are declining straight a student for 11 years  now a chronic c student  i find myself, once again, curled up in the corner of my room drenching my t shirt in tears and snot  my mind is currently consumed with the thoughts of, what did i do wrong? what am i worth? am i too ugly, just like i had always thought? why did i not connect the yeast infections and utis to my partner s disloyalty? can i trust anyone anymore? how will i go into my next relationship without insecurities?  i ve reached out to so many caring friends, but i know i m burdening them with my issues seeking professional help is not an option at the moment, as my parents believe that mental health issues do not exist they are genocide survivors, and they d tell me, how can you be so frail while living a cushioned life? i feel guilty disappointed numb confused selfish  but most of all, i am tired i need a long, long rest i recently read a post somewhere about how sleep is just a free trial of death sounds good to me  i pride myself on developing my own coping mechanisms, but are they really working if i continue to revisit that corner in my room?",352
9098,"I'm suicidal due to getting help is difficult.I'm 21 years old who have had suicidal thoughts for over 3 years.
I'm not sure if this even counts as an attempt but my first attempt was at college 3 years ago when I had anorexia. (Painkillers) I did have a lot of stomach pain and I was very close to going to the hospital but I spent 2 days in my bed before the pain was gone.

I do want to get help but the free therapy that you can get in England apparently does not have my 3 attempts of referral. It has been over 6 months!
My parents were able to find my private therapy but she charges a lot of money just for one lesson. (I could spend the money on DIO merch and having one lesson with her is making me very very anxious)  
Whenever I contact any suicidal number, they somehow find my parents mobile number and contact them. My parents get confused each time because they do not even explain to them that their daughter called them because she is being a suicidal little shit. I really would like to know how they find my parents phone number when I tell them each time to please not contact anyone else.
I have told each of my past therapists (4) that I am suicidal hoping that one of them would get me put in a hospital in a few days so that I would not end up killing myself. None of them told anyone at all because getting courage to tell a doctor or a hospital that I want to kill myself is too difficult for me to do due to anxiety and trust issues. 

Due to all of this happening, I have sadly started to eat less/control how much I eat which is eating back to my anorexia. When I tried to get help for my anorexia 3 years ago, I went to ask help from 4 different doctor and 3 different nurses who rejected me because I was at a healthy weight.

so i’ve been suicidal for awhile. since fifth grade, i’ve wanted to kill myself, and that’s when i did my first attempt. i’ve been alone for so long. so fucking long. i’ve never had any friends, any family, no one. and the only thing i care about in life is love. this might sound pathetic, but i am so in love with this one girl i know that i want to kill myself because of it. the fact that i know i’ll never be loved is painful. not just the fact that i’ll never be with her, but i’ll never be with anybody. no one has ever loved me, why should they start? i feel so weak. i feel so unliked. and im kinda friends with her but i feel like she hates me. i feel like everyone hates me. and i hate living with that fact. i hate that everyone hates me, but i know i deserve it. i don’t deserve love. i don’t deserve her. i tried to hang myself last night because i’m tired of being weak and im afraid of being hated, and i failed. i’ve never felt more weak.

and if this sounds creepy, i do want to clarify i am very young, and this girl i like is the same age as me. i don’t stalk her, or harass her. i respect her and her boundaries. one of the reasons why i want to kill myself is that i feel like i’m a bother and a disturbance to people, that no one likes me because i’m a weirdo. and please don’t tell me i’m too young to know what real love is, or too young to think this stuff. because that’s all i’ve ever been told my whole life, and i don’t need to be told that in a safe space

3037,"14 MonthsI can't believe it's 2013. My depression began at the end of 2011. In an attempt to get better I've been seeing a psychiatrist 2-4 times per month, and for a stretch of six months I met with both a psychologist and a life coach. 

With my doctor's help I've tried various cocktails of Zoloft, Lexapro, Abilify, Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Adderall and Ativan. None have helped my depression in a significant way. I've leaned on friends and family for support, improved my diet, and learned mindfulness meditation. (But I must admit I was never able to stick to the meditation for more than a week at a time.)

In short, I spent the last 14 months trying to get rid of my depression, but here I am tonight on SuicideWatch feeling as bad as I've ever felt.

I attempted to take my life last year, but my kidneys and liver were stronger than I gave them credit for. If I try again it will be with the help of the Golden Gate Bridge, which I'm told is 99% effective.

I know that if I continue to fight there's still a chance my depression would go away and I could end up happy again. The odds of this happening lie somewhere between 0 and 100%. But I also know that if I end my life the chances of the pain ending are 100%, and I won't be around to regret it. I suppose that's the tautology of suicide. Nobody who has killed themself has ever regretted it.

I'm practically convinced that ending my life is the better of my two options. The downside of course is the emotional toll it would take on my friends and family. But I counter that with the emotional and financial toll I'm already taking and would continue to take on them in the future.

Although I'm pretty convinced of my decision, I obviously haven't committed to it since I'm here asking for help.

3423,"Literally impossible for me to turn my life aroundI'm transgender. Been on hormones for 3 years almost.

I've worked out fashion choices, gotten good at makeup and have a good haircut and a so-so voice. But I can't pass to anyone. I'm just treated or assumed to be a femme gay guy no matter what I do. I regularly get stares, comments (made loud enough for me to hear), laughter, glares, sometimes slurs, sometimes people following me, passive-aggressively shitty service in most businesses I go to and taken advantage of guys who know that I'll sleep with them if they lie to me and tell me I'm pretty. Facial feminization surgery is $20k at least and with my shitty field choice I won't be making that any time soon. Plus, I suspect the surgery won't have that much effect on me as I've seen results and the changes are usually subtle i.e. pushing someone from andro to femme not from masculine to femme, so i'm fucked regardless. Also I'm sterile from the hormones. 

I know it's easy to tell people to just keep trucking and just keep going and to just not care what other people think, but let's be real if you were dehumanized every day no matter where you went your mental health would be pretty shitty too right? And this is in a liberal city so i don't have anywhere to escape to. What's even crueler is that i'm smart, that I'm qualified, that I'm  that I would definitely be happy with everything else if not for the one horrible thing ruining my life.

I dont understand where it's coming from but it's most likely that I'm 17 and my whole family is now emigrating from South Africa, where I live to the UK. although I feel no resentment towards this and I'm fine with moving in my head I must be disliking it or something cause recently it became very real and it's making me spiral mentally.

I have no friends cause once they learned I was moving to the UK they all carried on with their school lives and forgot about me cause I'm not attending due to the move. I originally told my one friend I'm depressed and my eating has gone out the window to a point where I'm lucky if I eat 2 sandwiches in a day. I'm not insecure, I'm not sad, I'm not angry and I'm not vengeful or spiteful towards my parents. I know I'm loved but I just feel so empty. As if nothing matters, not even my life.

Not to die. I dont want to take my life but I dont want to exist. I feel like I'll never amount to anything and nothing matters or ever will.

I'm sure I could find more to write about but it's not coming to mind right now, just looking for some advice other than it will get better cause that's what everyone says so I guess I have no choice but to believe it.

However, he also says that he can't be satisfied sexually with just me.  He wants an open relationship so he can fool around with cis men.  I'm transgender, and it's killing me that he wants the one body part that I don't have more than he wants to be happy with me.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet.""  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues.  He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be.  As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him.  I hate my body more than ever before.  I hate myself.

When I reflect on my life I see so much pain. So much hurt and betrayal. Why would I want to continue on and live
in this world? What's the point? To get hurt more? 

Is this living life to the fullest? Watching people lie to each other 
and hurt each other? 

Constantly being the shoulder to lean on when I myself have no shoulder. I want to be able to depend 
on someone...Not a lover but a friend. Someone I can talk to who will listen without judgement. 

Some one who won't make 
it about themselves. Does that make me selfish? I guess so. I wish I could forget....everything. 

I wish I could start over. But you only get one shot, right? All I can think of is how much of an idiot I am. 
Sitting here writing this. No one's going to read this. No one cares.
I'm just being a baby right? I just need to grow up.

But I don't want to continue. I have no one. Why should I continue? I have no shoulders to lean on while I try to build myself back up.

I'm just something to be manipulated. Always have been. I'm just an outlet for people to take there issues out on. 

The one person I needed most doesn't need me. Doesn't care. Why should I waste my time?? I don't want to hurt anymore.

I'm so tired of hurting. I'm so tired of disappointment and pain. That's all this is. Everywhere I turn, nothing but disappointment and pain.

What's the point? I'm replaceable. I'm easily replaceable. There's billions of people out there. No one is really going to miss me.

I'm in my 20s and I'm still living with my parents. I went to college and got a worthless degree and worked a terrible job for years and had to quit because my boss was physically harassing and threatening me and the company wouldn't do anything about it. Of course I had no back-up plan. I was unemployed for a year and did nothing. My parents threatened to kick me out of the house unless I got a job or got into a program at a school. I ended up getting into a post-bacc program for medicine. My parents were so proud of me because they thought it was my first step to becoming a doctor. But that's never going to happen. First and foremost I'm too fucking stupid. And second, *I don't want to do that shit.*

I have suffered from mental illness all my life. I've tried to kill myself three times before, been institutionalized, all that happy horseshit. I was an alcoholic throughout my early twenties. I have no friends. I have no skills. My parents are fucking nuts. I *love* them, but they're fucking nuts. My mum lives in a bubble world. She hasn't worked since she was in college and spent all her time raising me and now that I'm older she has no hobbies or friends. My dad is a Trump-supporting fanatic who still thinks it's the 1980s. They don't understand the world. They don't want to. They're real boomers. 

I have no plans, no money, no credit, no ambitions, no desires. I don't want to have children. I don't want to get married or have a house. I don't want to work. I'm pathetic.

I'm not intending to kill myself. I've made plans, but I can't follow through. Last time I tried, everyone hated me for it, and I can barely imagine breaking the trust they've managed to give me back. Maybe after a bit more of this I'll begin to not mind. I hope so, because it hurts, and I'd like it to stop hurting, and it's not going to stop all on its own. If only I had done it right the first time.

Sometimes I wake up and find myself optimistic, though that feeling tends to die off quite swiftly. Then I'm back to googling ""how to get cancer easily"", which I'm aware is entirely retarded, but I've got no options besides managing to die naturally \(and also stupid searches like that are probably a coping mechanism\). Well, why is it that every person killed in an accident is a person so full of life and purpose, and I can't manage anything worse than a papercut? Maybe I could trade places with one of them, and that would be the best thing I'd have done for the world in my entire life.

I wish I had real depression. Then I at least wouldn't feel like I'm a fucking poser, and maybe I would have the guts to go through with it, everyone else be damned. That would be better for all of them in the long run, because I'm completely and utterly wasting their physical and emotional resources for nothing.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I haven't said half of the feelings I wanted to express, but I'm feeling better now, and by that I mean I don't feel as bad because I feel kinda empty.

On January 2020, I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and it's taking its toll on me. I couldn't go to therapy because of the coronavirus outbreak. Whenever me and my mother have arguments, I'm always the wrong one. She always keeps herself on top, and I couldn't take things anymore. I just want to die. Prolonging the time before we die is senseless: because we'll all die in the future anyway.

What's the point of living, really? We just get raised by our parents, then what? Compete ourselves with others using our learned skills and knowledge, and compete for the best resources available? Try to gain as much experiences, relationships, achievements, knowledge, and satisfaction, when at the end you'll just die anyway? 

Humans are worthless, selfish pieces of crap. All we ever really did was compete for resources. And they didn't even see global warming as a result of their selfish deeds, competing for resources against the other species of the animal kingdom. Not only that: Humans are well known to compete with other humans too. You have IQ and skills? You climb up the hierarchy. Acquire financial and relationship status. Gain self esteem. You don't have IQ or skills? You stay down the ladder. Live the worst life possible. None to low financial or relationship status. You gain the least esteem. All because of fucking brain and hormonal differences.  

The world is mad. We just stress ourselves out for senseless selfish deeds, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. We are just letting emotional and physical pains, insecurities, anxieties, and fears of death stay on our sides, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. 

Or should I say, we are just prolonging the time left before our final line: death. It's senseless.

11441,"I don't think I can commit to it but I am constantly thinking about itSo ever since I started college I began falling behind in pretty much all aspects of my life. I wasn't making any friends and I was doing poorly in all my classes (never formed a study habit). It continued for a year or two and I was hiding my grades from my parents. It got bad enough that I eventually had to tell them and I medically withdrew and transferred closer to home. I thought a fresh start could help and not having the burden of those lies would allow me to get on track. Now I'm another year in and I'm doing it again. I don't want to kill myself but I do feel that dying wouldn't be too bad. I know that school and all that isn't anything to kill yourself over and it isn't the end of the world but I have no motivation. I want to make something creative, I have videos that need editing, ideas that I want to flesh out, etc. but I just am either too lazy or unmotivated to do any of them. I'm starting to give up on college and know that the only way for me to be successful is to focus on these creative endeavors and make something out of it. I just can't start working on them and I don't know why. I just fall back onto playing video games instead, even though I'm not even having much fun playing them.

490,"And here I am once again.Back to feeling extremely suicidal again. I made a post in /r/depression a few days ago, hoping I wouldn't get this suicidal again. I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago (not in a way I had to see a hospital) and I never told anyone in real life about it. 
My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.

I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.

4634,"I need some advice. I’m a high schooler and there’s a girl I really like. I haven’t had much experience with girls, I’ve had 2 girlfriends and one of them cheated. Btw I’m not into sexual relationships. I haven’t liked anyone in a whole year, which isn’t abnormal but it’s been awhile nonetheless. She doesn’t really talk, but she has gotten more comfortable with me. We basically have one class together and we talk sometimes. I have no way of getting in contact with her outside of school. I want to start talking to her one on one but I can’t get to her on social media without outrightly seeking her out and friending her. She has no mutual friends either so I can’t just say that it came up in my recommended. I get along with her on more obscure topics rather than music or other heavy topics. I can’t help but smile when I’m around her, and I can’t stop thinking about her. I feel like a creep when I smile around her, I try so hard to not smile but it doesn’t work all the time. I haven’t been quiet in a long time but I feel myself easing back into that because I’m Semi-shy. Although people laugh at my jokes when I’m spastic so I guess maybe I should do that to get her to laugh. I’ve thought about asking for her number but idk if that would make things awkward or not. In 3 months prom is coming up. I didn’t plan on going unless something changed but I know she’s going so this may be my chance. I’m not a great dancer either. I’ve thought about putting my number in a card for Valentine’s Day (because our school lets us by Crush soda and send it to someone) but idk if the school would let me do that.

I have a sister who was also healthy at a young age, but 6 years ago she developed a weird chronic cough that wouldn't go away. She went to tons of doctors none of them knew what it could be until one day a doctor said she should be tested for ""Cystic Fibrosis"", I had no idea what it even was, no one in my family tree did. However, she got a cat scan, and a blood test. The cat scan showed multiple cysts in her lungs and kidney. The blood test came back positive for CF and now life is living hell after researching this horrible diesease I'm ready to kill myself. Now, if you think the worst part is over you are mistaken. about a year ago I started having issues in the morning constant throat clearing, minor coughing (not like my sister but still annoying). Feels like there is something in my throat and my mother also started having the same thing at the same time. Me and mother have been having this strange weird coughing/throat clearing sessions in the morning for the past year and doctor just told me it was minor swelling however I am a hypochondriac so now I've pretty much set myself death date. I cannot live with this horrible problem my mother should not even be HAVING any issue as she is 48 even the specialist said it would be impossible for my mother to have this diesease. Knowing that I could now have the same dieases my sister however, and knowing I could soon be having lung problems scares me to death. I'll be getting blood tested soon for the diease. After I get blood tested I'll probably just end it.

I dont wanna be lonly anymore 
I just want things to be like before.
I just wanna kill myself
My wrist is bloody and my eyes are red.
Over a girl i never fucking met


I just wanna leave everything behind.
And blow away my fucking mind.
To be wraped in a bloddy sheat
And be droped 6ft underneath 

Every day i think abouth her
I fucking loved that girl
She was my only hope 
Oh men she was so fucking dope. 

I remember how we talked day and night. 
How i felt that every thing is right.
I realy miss talking withe her.
I think she was my perfect girl 

And now after i lost it all
I wana crawl in a ball and.. 

I just wanna kill myself
I dont wanna be lonly anymore 
I just want things to be like before.
I just wanna kill myself
My wrist is bloody and my eyes are red.
Over a girl i never fucking met 

Now ill take my rum ill take my noose
And ill let my neck fall lose
Ill take the chair from beneth my feet 
And my heart will stop to beat. 

Thats all because.....

Into the fire where i will drown
My skin melts off as i descend
And Satan tears me limb from limb

12229,"I’m a dick and drunk!I really fucked up. I was having a good time with someone - someone who I enjoyed chatting with  but I messed up. 

I was supposed to be spending time with them, but I got drunk. I didn’t realise my being drunk would upset them, but I should of. Anyone who was sober would have realised. Who the fuck wants to listen to some fucking drunk, rambling on? I just didn’t think and totally pissed them off. 

I’m trying to balance so many balls, but what I failed to realise was that all the balls are already on the floor - I’m just pretending that I’m still keeping everything in the air. I’m faking it so well I even began believing the lie. 

The thing is, this person, for a brief moment when we chatted, I completely forgot about the balls. It didn’t matter where they were. I was lost in the moment but tonight I failed. Being drunk ruined everything. 

Now I’m not writing this post for sympathy, to make them feel guilty, or as some kind of - it’s not my fault please forgive me crap. My actions are my own, no one else’s. I just want them to know that appreciated the time I spent with them. That for the short time we spoke, they made a difference, and that I truly appreciated their presence - however short and random it may have been. 

Thing is, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. The common denominator?Me. There is no easy fix. If my attempt had worked a few days ago, then this wouldn’t have happened. I would have been forgotten like a dream. I wouldn’t have known their disappointment. 

There are a few things I know for certain -
1. I wrote this for myself. I’m not looking for forgiveness. In fact, I hope they never find and read this. They don’t need to. 
2. I’m a dick. A complete arsehole. 
3. This world is better without me.

I don't have religion (nor want it). I don't have kids (nor want them). I have family, but I'm not close (nor care to be). I mean, they are nice and loving. But their beliefs make my head hurt sometimes (my mother believes in miracles and that the Virgin Mary communicates to her through dreams. My family only encourages this.)

Life just seems like a big pointless hassle. I'm broke. I have a job. I have lots of bills. I don't have a lot of friends. I mean I know plenty of people but I'm not good at making friends.

That's it. But, honestly if that's all I've got to look forward to, what's the point? 

I didn't know if I ought to post here because I am not planning on killing myself or anything. But, I would honestly rather not be living. I think I would probably fail if I tried to kill myself and that would just be even more hassle. Dealing with more people. So, I don't entertain the idea of trying. But I lie in bed and I think, I just wish I were done. I wish it was all over.

I don't like feeling like this. Nothing that anyone has said, oh you're beautiful, you're wonderful, you're intelligent, you're awesome. Nothing actually makes me feel better.

I also feel trapped because I refuse to kill myself before my parents pass, sister and brother in law are busy with a family of their own and can forget more easily given time.

I know you're here for now, but soon I think you'll leave. Even you can't thats not true. 

Don't get me wrong, everything this girl has done for me is more than I could have ever asked for. I love her but I've loved a lot of people, friends, boys, etc. and all have left me at one point or another. So when the day comes that she does leave I wont be suprised but I'll miss her dearly. 

I have convinced myself that death is the only way out of all this pain I'm in. I still believe that and I'm pretty sure I always will. ""No it's not. It does get better. You just got to hold on."" I'm done with that bullshit. That believing in a fairytale ending doesn't erase my past. It doesn't erase the day I found my dads secret stash of chewing tobacco, or when I first cut myself, or tried to kill myself, or thought about not eating and throwing up whatever I did eat.

4453,"kinda scared that my mouth breathing habit has changed how I look Ever since I was small I slept with my mouth open. I got braces and they completely fixed my teeth after I got them removed. I’m happy with my smile and I feel like they kinda changed the shape of my jaw in a good way. The thing is that I still sleep with my mouth open even though I don’t have breathing problems. It’s only at night and breathing with my mouth open makes me feel less claustrophobic and it feels better. The orthodontist had told me when I first got braces that my mouth shrunk because I slept with my mouth open. Every time I mention this to people they think it’s stupid but you’d think a doctor knows what they’re talking about. They said that the reason my teeth got messed up in the first place is because my tongue wasn’t resting against the top of my mouth when I slept. 

I’m seriously considering sleeping with a sleep tape on my mouth now just so maybe my face might look better. I’ve always thought the way my face looks is kind of odd but it seems like a lot of people don’t really have a clear idea of how they look. At this point I don’t know if I’m attractive or unattractive but I’m willing to sleep with my mouth closed if that’ll do anything tbh. The idea that maybe the reason I look weird is all because I sleep with my mouth open is kinda scary and hopefully it’s not too late to try to fix this. This is basically the reason I got braces in the first place.

I can still see my jawline and I can’t see my gums when I smile. Overall, I don’t see too much of the problems that come along with sleeping with your mouth open but maybe that’s because I got braces at an early age.

2598,"I'm freaking the fuck out. I can't function as an adult.not that I could function as a kid either, but as I'm becoming older my weirdness is becoming more and more of a problem. 

I'll just quickly say that I developed social phobia in the 7th grade. Since I shied away from everyone, I had no friends (besides my brother's friends who were only my friends because of my brother) all the way through high school. I get to college and run into the same problems. I never admitted it to myself until recently, but I've had severe depression/apathy for a very long time.

I no longer have social phobia, but I can't bring myself to show my personality. I've shown less and less of my personality as the years have gone by to the point that I'm now a complete fucking weirdo. And this isn't just around strangers and acquaintances I'm talking about; this is around my own brother and my cousin who is basically my sister. I can't be myself or show myself to anyone. I've recently tried 'practicing' by myself and trying to figure who I fucking am anymore and I don't like what I see and hear.

I took shrooms about two weeks ago and now instead of bottling everything away in pure apathy, I now care like a normal person. And I just want to die...even though I of course don't actually want to die. I want to be happy and comfortable being myself around people, but since I can't do that and will never be able, I want to die.

And I'm freaking out. I constantly have this terrible feeling in my stomach like I'm about to give a speech to a crowd of over 1000 people (and just giving a short presentation in class is one of my least favorite things in the world)... and it won't go away.

I'm 16, I have high ADHD, I'm off and on with my medications, my grades are mediocre, and the most basic thing is that I dont feel happy or sad. Never both or one of the other.

I haven't felt sad, I haven't felt happy, something in my brain switched in 7th grade and I just never felt any thing worth awhile. I keep on saying that mental health will recover on it's own, that in just attention seeking, I'm over reacting and my emotions dont count as much as my peers or family.

It is hard for me to make eye contact with my closest friends, I'm losing friends, and it's never been harder to get them, I have no ambition, I do sports for my parents to make them happy. I never liked them.

I haven't done anything for myself and it's always been for my closest friends or parents. Sometimes I feel like when the text me it's just for me to give them something. Like I have no value other than car rides and food. I have no value to anyone.

9720,"Goodbye!I have serious mental illness, accompanied by many physical illnesses (mainly overweight, high bp, problems with my spine) and I'm only 28. Which is surprising. 

My memory and intelligence are destroyed due to psychiatric illness and drugs, it's quite difficult to recall even recent events. 

I don't have disability and probably wouldn't be able to make it quickly however disability paycheck in my country don't cover even basic physiological needs. 

Recently I've got from ophtalmologist a note that my eyes are fucked up due to high bp. So +1 disease. 
  
That's just too much drugs and too much medical advice for me. Given that I don't have any savings and currently unemployed (though I don't believe that anything will change in the future) I believe soon I wouldn't be able not only to pay for health but even to buy myself food. 

So I'm deeply fucked. And there is no hope, no way to get out, nothing to be changed. Well, there are some people for whom suicide might be quite an option. Rationally speaking. 

I'm definetly going to do this since my departure would make some people's life only easier. The other wouldn't be bothered. 

The only thing that bugs me - the whole transition phase. I've always been scared to die in my sleep, I've always wanted to experience death in real-time. Just to be able to kind of observe my last moments in real-time. 

But looking at chances and suicide statistics - well, It wouldn't be possible. I'm too scared of ropes. And there is no way I could have find a gun. So I'm going to die being unconscious. My last experience would be falling asleep, not experiencing death. 

The last couple of months I was hesitating, struggling back and forth - whether or not to do it, maybe I would somehow adapt, maybe I would be able to live. Now I'm finished with lying to myself.

4037,"i bet noone cares i die, so im just waiting on the edgeMy depression seems to get worse and worse. I last posted 3 months ago where i thought i hit rock bottom. Now i know rock bottom doesn't exist. It can always get worse. Im 14, just sitting on the edge of a bridge, noone to talk to because im a lonely fuck who everyone who lays their eyes on thinks is a ugly cunt. I cant take my life anymore. I just.. Cant. Ive been riddled with problems at home since i was six. Drunk knife wielding dad who just doesn't care. I ran from home because my parents continously screamed that they wish i was dead in my ears and my dad decided to get drunk and get a metal rod, so i jumped out of my window not wanting another broken bone.

Past couple days ive just been staying under bridges, haven't slept for days or eaten for days either. Only thing i like anymore is music. How ive held on so long is beyond me. Maybe is because i have a glimmer of hope that If i do my brother will care. But the one whos 17 just screames and tells me that im an idiot. And my 4 year old brother, well. Idk if hell even Remember me.

Im stuck. I cant tell any social services because if im taken from my parents, my mum might kill herself (shes had a past of depression but gt out of it) . And i cant take that risk. She lives for her children. Idk if she loves me but she certainly does my other brothers. Shes only with my dad for them. So i cant tell anyone who can make a change. And things have gotten better between my parents, just not between me and them.

Lately, it's been nothing but hell. I don't want to kill myself. I really don't want to. I don't want to, but doesn't it look so nice? I hate that I want to kill myself. Anything to escape this constant terrifying adrenaline. This constant guilt. This constant self loathing. My mind is tricking me and I'm buying it. 
I have lost my father and very close friend to suicide and spent years working passionately against the cause. How did this happen to me?
I feel like I'm the type of girl that nobody would suspect hates herself so much, spends so much time just trying to convince herself there is something worth living for, that nobody lends a hand. In their defense, I don't ask.  I don't even want to go to my counsellor anymore because I feel so fucking guilty making her listen to me over and over, complaining about the same god damn thing. 
I feel as if I've run out of coping mechanisms that work. And I don't want to pull the plug on my life. But unfortunately I really REALLY do. I just feel like I can't suffer for very much longer. Anyway... I guess what I'm asking is for your help. What are your coping mechanisms... Not the bullshit, take a bath, have a tea garbage that only discourages you into hating yourself more. Does anyone have any quotes, pictures, songs, stories, activities, recovery experiences that they found helpful?
I can't really even believe I'm writing this, and have this weird sense of embarrassment even though I'm totally anonymous right now, but you guys..

6419,"Yep. I lost my job. Over dumpster diving.Past few years everything was going awful and the start of this year actually was going well. I thought I would be able to do better. I had a stable job that I liked where I worked with people who I liked. The pay wasn't fantastic but it was better than nothing. Then on Monday I get put on suspension and not told why, at all, until Friday. I go in in the morning for a meeting with HR people, my manager, some other lady and my union rep, because apparently we're unionized at a gas bar. I sit down and they proceed to tell me that I'm under investigation for theft. What did I steal? Expired food from the dumpster. Evidently, this is tantamount to theft and against their company policy. Immediately fired after I said yes because I didn't think that anyone would fire me for being poor. The only reason I 'stole' it was because I had no fucking food otherwise. 

So I'm out of a job. Great. Shitty considering I'm $200 short on my rent for February 1st. I could have said ""Hey I'll have the last bit on my next cheque"" before but now I don't have anything to fall back on. I'm going to be homeless in a few days. I just lost my job that actually made me kinda happy and now I get absolutely nothing. I don't have a scrap of food in the fucking house, the post I made on Random Acts of Pizza as a hail mary to go ""Oh maybe I can get SOMETHING out of this piece of shit day"" went no where. Just downvoted to hell. No way to pay rent, no food to eat, nothing to do. Stealing WiFi from a neighbor, having to sit outside to get it.

I have one child that I attempted to raise on my own and failed as a father and had to ask my parents to step in to ensure he’d had a good life. I did 3.5 years out of a 4 year enlistment in the navy. Booted for drug possession. I placed 3rd at regionals in wrestling in high school my junior year. Was favored to win regionals my senior year. I quit, 2 weeks in to spend time with my gf who left me 8 months later during my second week at basic training. I had a job working in customer service. Excelled. Three months in, was asked to apply for trainer position. Got it. Completed 2 month certification, excited about a career that allowed me to help others. Two weeks after cert, our dept closed. 
Went to work at a factory. Started as stacker , four years in I was a machine op training to be line lead. Factory closed its doors. Engaged twice. Broke it off both times. I’ve failed at everything I’ve ever attempted. I’ve never completed anything I started. 

Looking back, the only happiness I’ve ever experienced was manufactured and fake. 

I’m sitting in my car at Walmart. I do this every weekend. Hoping I’ll see someone I know and they will acknowledge my existence. I’m a sensitive person and  I determine my self worth by how many people need me. I have not spoken to a human in 3 weeks face to face. 

I posted on Facebook many years ago that i would judge my life at the end by how many people’s lives I touched, how many people I helped. I can count on one hand the amount of people who will recognize my name from my obit. 

In every way possible, I’ve failed. I tried though. No one will know , but I tried. I cared.

Only my father who has not a lot of empathy and probably feels guilty after he didn’t care for my life, my feelings my whole life. 
My mother was extremely unhappy and probably depressed as well. She emotionally neglected me and I lost the love and the trust to her I had. She died 9 years ago. 
My life consisted of the avoidance circle of weed, internet, games, isolation and porn. No luck with women. Only girlfriend cheated on me, because I couldn’t get it up and was lost. Can’t blame her. This was at age 25 btw, after some years of suffering. I didn’t manage to do a lot of exams and lied to my father. Will only write one on Monday, but even this is too much and thinking of it extremely stressful. If i fail it Im done at my college. Completely useless. I managed to stay away from weed since 8 weeks and from tobacco since 4 weeks, I did NoFap for 4 months without relapse. Nothing seems to help. Still no libido and pointless to even hope for a relationship. Medication what also fuck my libido and every chance to not being alone.
The worst thing is that I have no clue how I could ever be loved, either by a woman or by myself. My dreams of becoming a husband and a father bursted like a bubble. It’s devastating. 
At the weekend I might end it. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I don’t think anything knows how pointless my life feels and how much I hate myself. More or less I lived in this state for 8 years.

I don't know what to do. I took then half of what I'm supposed to be the max dosis for a day and now I'm still having a breakdown. It was supposed to stop me from ending my life and to get through these hard days after a break up with my ex partner. But now I'm sitting here crying again and planning to end it. I now took even more of it and I'm getting so tired typing this because of it. I can only take a few of it to reach the maximum dose for today... My feelings are overwhelming. 
I think the only solution left is to get myself into a clinic so I can go on with it right now. But don't want to call my best friend, the only one I could take that step with. She's busy with exams and sleeping and I can't be the one that makes it harder or impossible for her.
I clearly feel how I'm getting more tired and tired so maybe I can just do it one more night. I don't want to lose everything I had. But I already did and there's no chance it will be alright. I'm so sick like I never was I just want it to be over.

14941,"Wondering If I Am OkayI worry sometimes I might kill myself. Idk why but I struggle with this notion a lot. I am 24. I am smart, I have a university and post grad degree. 

I quit almost every job I get because of this. I feel anxious very often, makes it difficult to sleep/ work sometimes. I find maintaining relationships very difficult because of my mood swings. 

Every day I wake up feeling different so I can't make a decision on anything. I don't know if I will feel the same tomorrow...

Weed used to help, use to love lsd and mushrooms. Real good vibes hippy type, still felt depressed/ anxious often. After my girlfriend had an abortion/ left me for some bumble match things got worse. I started using benzo's to help with anxiety. 

I overdosed on xanax and cocaine before. I haven't even touched a substance in a year and still think about death a handful of times a day. I've tried anti-depressants they don't work for me. Haven't touched those in a year either.

who would miss me when I do die? Nobody.

My parents have been divorced for a long time and it definitely has had a hard effect on me considering that the relationship between them now is quite hostile.
The reason Ive been feeling this way is because of some recent events. My mums abusive partner (not my dad) has finally left after 9 years,  however it isn't what I thought it will be like. Rather than me, my sis and mum being more united, we are arguing and fighting more than ever. The financial situation hasn't been the best either woth my mum running a business in which I have to work every weekend. I do enjoy helping out but more and more Om lacking energy, falling asleep in school etc. and I don't know how long I can keep up. 
The endless arguments with my mum sometimes cause her to be violent and every time we do argue I feel like shit later and feel absolutely worthless. I put up a fake attitude in school so that everyone thinks its perfect at home and that Im mean to people because I choose to be rather than me choosing to lash out because I can't hold it in anymore.

16306,"My roommate/ex-GF is trying to commit suicideWe were living together when we broke up last year. I left but came back to support her. The break-up happened during a bad time for her financially. She was unemployed and is just starting to find a new job. She does have a new partner by then already but she is not yet comfortable living with him (one of the reasons why we decided to part ways is that guy btw). When I came back at around September last year, I ‘kinda wanted to win her back but that died down and realized I just really wanted to help.

Fast forward to now, covid-19 happened and she is in a bad place again with her job  due to the quarantine and decided to break up with her partner. Childhood trauma of being trapped and being denied from her “distractions” is taking a huge toll on her mental health. Then her old feelings for me resurfaced. She then said she still loves me and wants me back. I said to her in pure honesty that I cannot and she is just probably feeling confused due to her being trapped with me. She’s forcing it upon me but I really cannot do it anymore. These are her main reasons on why she wants everything to end.

Now I feel trapped and I do not know what to do. I cannot make myself to pretend that there is still a chance between us just to make things better. Am losing sleep and needed to skip work a couple of times just to be on guard with her. She tried to run towards the balcony and was able to stop her twice already which really rattled me and making me paranoid. She is preventing me from messaging her relatives and I feel obliged to comply because it might make things worst if I do.

 So I plan to leave it when I'm old enough to go and live out on my own. But I dont want to be lonely, I would never be able to talk to my family ever again practically. And if they were to try and reach out to me then they could get in trouble to. So I have 3 choices with my life. 
1, either I stay and just suffer my whole life having to deal with this religion until my parents were to die. 
2, leave the religion and my family as soon as I can have my own living arrangements and a steady job setup and have to put up with never being able to tall to my family ever again.
3, just killing myself would be the easiest way out. I've already done so many stupid things throughout my life and my parents can already tell I'm not doing that good in this religion.

9674,"Losing the War within (veteran)I dont know if it is the right spot for this but I feel it belongs here

I am a veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and have been in the civilian world for 5 years now. After I got out I felt that the world was mine. I never thought of the time I spent overseas and really got along well with everything. Held down jobs with increasing responsibility and even finished college. I live in the SF Bay Area which is notorious for being a stressful place. 

However in the last year I have been having terrible night terrors. It is almost like my sub concious takes over when I ""sleep"" and destroys my mind. After sleeping for 8 hours I wake up feeling terrible. The dreams are not there but I can feel that it was a painful experience. I lost my job after not being able to show up after a terrible night after terrible night. My girlfriend left because of this, she even filmed it for me after much denial on my part. After I witnessed this I was shocked. In my sleep I turn into a fearful and extemely stressed person. Like I am in combat every night. 

To ward off this I have been drinking pretty heavily. The other night I was very drunk and put an un loaded handgun in my mouth to see if I had the guts to do that. It has become a horrible cycle. My emotions are so out of whack that I am hardly able feel any real joy anymore. I just go through the motions and wonder if it is my time. I feel that my purpse is through, maybe my contribution in this life was my deployments. Maybe that was what I was meant to do and no more. I look to god to find this truth. Why am I still alive if that was my purpose?

15651,"Please help need adviceThis is literally my first post ever on this site, and I wish it wasn't. My female cousin who is barely older than me is falling deeper and deeper into depression. She has had a bunch of things happen in her life that may have led to this point. Her dad was constantly short tempered and was willing to use physical discipline to get his point across. Keep in mind, we grew up in the Philippines, where it is acceptable to use physical discipline on your kids. Our family has a history of being extremely short tempered which I think comes from my grandmother and she passed it on to her kids. Our family loves to yell and berate you for any small wrong doing that they think you did. They also like to butt into whatever you were doing in life. My cousins know the feeling as they literally couldn't even travel outside the state without being yelled at for not informing our extended family. These factors and other events like her boyfriend and her going through a pretty rough patch in their relationship has made her depressed. She recently told me that she has started to take pills to calm herself down. I'm no doctor so I don't know what she is taking. She has been telling me that it is harder for her to feel any emotion other than anger and sadness, and that she is slowly starting to think that life isn't worth living. She also has started to contemplate cutting herself, and has confided in me that she has thought of ending it then and there multiple times now. Like I wish she was joking, but she seems pretty serious. She also told me not to tell anyone about it, so informing our family is out the window as it will signal a large breach of trust between me and her.

2656,"Pity doesn’t helpI’m about to be admitted to the very hospital I currently work at (though obviously not for much longer). A lady there during orientation said her “heart goes out to suicide ideation patients because y’all there are some people that don’t think their life is worth living and that just hurts my heart for them” and my (internal) reaction being such a person without her realizing was “b— no one said your life was worth living either. I could have literally any life and I would still want to die.” Basically my point is pity is not helpful because we are not less than you. 
Aside from that it really sucks but it’s true even though my specific life is extremely difficult and hard to deal with I cannot imagine any possible life where I would be okay apart from maybe just inheriting a couple million dollars. (Not going to happen any time soon.) 
I can’t think of any job where I would be okay or any way of life where I would be okay.

Tried to find a doctor but they said it will be at least a week and a half for my first app with a therapist and two weeks after that to see a psychiatrist. I don’t have a regular doctor and all the local doctors charge a $120 new patient fee on top of the appointment itself.   My husband says he will take me to commit myself tomorrow but my hospital triggers the anxiety and it’s the only good hospital there is so everything just suck and knowing from the backside they are just pitying me doesn’t help.

3044,"I do nothing but hurt people.  Sorry in advance for the novel...

I have no family and no friends whom I do not hurt.  I'm a selfish bitch and I honestly feel that I would be doing a service to the world if I expunge myself from it.  To allow myself, as destructive as I am, to continue to live would be selfish.

Today was my breaking point.  The two people I respect and look up to the most in the entire world I have hurt and disappointed, and they are upset with me and I cannot take it anymore.  They are my research advisors, (they are married), and I loved them as dearly as a daughter would love her parents (I always wanted parents, but I've been alone my whole life, save for a meth-addicted father who sold my body to his friends for drug money when I was 13-14 and is now in prison).  

Recently, I was taken advantage of by an old high school friend and I've been struggling emotionally since that night. Two days ago, I told one of them that I was really anxious and a bit vulnerable, but yesterday he completely snapped at me (for what I perceive as no real reason - it was a miscommunication).  I left the lab in tears, but I returned today because I do have work to do.  However, when I arrived my other advisor took me aside and told me that I'm too emotional and that I have been causing stress to her husband, whom I idolize.

And two days ago, I made on of my friends cry.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I can't take it anymore.  I can't take the fact that I'm so self-absorbed I hurt everyone, EVERY ONE I care about.  I can't stand myself.

5154,"Planning to OD this weekendI'm planning to OD this weekend. Wanted to do it today after getting panic attack at new job that I really need to stay afloat but I couldn't withstand the anxiety. Called HR of another company I really wanted to work for but they wouldn't have me because I'm in extramural college (I'm 30). Due to COVID situation I'm in great debt (can't make rent this month...) so I had to cancel my education so I called that company back today. The recruiter remembered me (we had an interview 2 months ago) and they had highly positive feedback about me but she needs to talk with the supervisior and said that she'll get back to my by the end of the week. If not for that I'd be trying to OD right now but I'll wait. If this won't work out then it's lights out for me...

The financial situation isn't the reason behind it all. Things have built up over the years and I tried getting help. Seen 2 therapist over the span of 3 years, been medicated and not much has changed. Getting BA degree was something I was looking forward to and now that I have to cancel it I lost last bit of hope that I can turn around my life. I get serious panic attacks whenever I start blue collar job (which is what I can get in my city right now). I guess it just hit me that even when I'm pushed against the wall financially the job offers right now really trigger my suicidal thoughts tenfold...

6256,"I don’t have a good titleHello,

I don’t know what I’m hoping to accomplish posting this but I’m just hoping somebody can at least see it.

I feel like I am completely falling apart, and at the same time I feel so stupid for feeling that way. Everything that has happened is my fault, my entire situation is my fault.

I don’t think my mind has ever felt normal, my family has a long history of depression but I always thought it could never happen to me so I pushed any dark thoughts far away.

My head feels like it’s imploding every second of the day and it’s getting worse, I still live at home and Im so torn because all I want to do is get out but I’m so scared of being alone with myself. I feel so trapped all of the time but I’m also scared to be alone. I miss my girlfriend so much, I left her and it was a mistake but I shouldn’t go back on it, I left her for the most selfish reasons because I’m a cunt.

Im so sick of people telling me how well I’ve done already when I feel like a complete and total failure. I never feel like I’m going to get to where I want to be in life because I don’t even know where that is. I’m fucked financially I have debts that terrify me and I don’t know what to do about them. I know of all the proactive things that I should do but instead I just drink and distract myself with my head in the sand.

All of that is why I feel so fucking stupid, I’m not doing anything to help myself because I don’t deserve it, I put myself in this situation so why shouldn’t I suffer.

3416,"My ""life"" ended a long time agoI'm posting here because I'm for the most part done with living. Life has nothing to offer me. Never has. 

First, I'm going to describe myself so those who will be turned off by talking with someone like me will know up front.

I'm 5'3"", about 150, 55 years old, medium-brown skinned female, short small nose, a jutted jaw with thin lips, sunken eyes, a metal hip and cataracts. Face looks flat from the side and people have called me ""retard"" or ""Down syndrome"" because of it. I might actually have something wrong with me genetically. I've always had poor muscle tone. So there, I'm ugly, and on top of that, I'm probably a narcissist with schizoid affective disorder, have been hospitalized in medical and mental institutions more than 15 times. I was assaulted in one of the mental institutions. 

I have never stopped thinking of committing suicide. I think about it every single day, have done so since my early teens. I was almost successful back in 2011. Worst day ever for the entire world. I should have died then, at least.

Not one person on this earth is compatible with me. Several people have said to me, ""Don't nobody want you,"" and they have been right. Even the guy I was married to and divorced didn't like me for anything but as much money he could spend. I can't think of one family member with whom I've been close. I'm a burden to them all, and that number has always been around five or less.

So, for all of my life, I've been pushed off on people whose job it was to ""provide services"" to me. Now, even those people don't want the job.

So what's left?

I do not know how to live, I would like to find a job but right now I am considered old and have no experience in my field(IT), and they don't give chances to people like me(At least in my zone, but I dont have money to move other places).

I have considered to try and work for the goverment( I have been supposedly studying  2 years for tit...but I did nothing) and I find it impossible to focus while studying.

But I can't be a woman. My voice is too deep, shoulders too large. I have Sasquatch feet(size 11 US) and hands that can almost palm a basketball. I have a small waist and large forehead as well. Taken individually, these things are nothing. Together, even estrogen and surgery cannot save me. Only a fool would believe me a woman. I will not insult the world by demanding that they respect an artificial subject carved out through cheap hormones and surgery. Chopping my balls off will not give me a vagina. Silicone in my chest will not give me breasts. I'll never be a mother. I want to be a woman, not a trans woman. I want to know life as a female from childhood onward, not change after testosterone decided to give my body a giant ""fuck you"". This is the reason why I must die. The afterlife seems so promising.

I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing.

9007,"My past 10 monthsDuring my first year in college the turmoil inside my head has only grown darker. While the work and extracurricular activities may served as distractions during term-time, the reality is that this affliction has continued to brew and fester, threatening to encroach my very being at any moment.  It is becoming ever so clear that I am hauntingly empty, especially now that we are on summer vacation where I have nothing but time to reflect on my existence. 

Yes, I will (hopefully) have a degree which will increase my likelihood of earning a higher income. But so what? Money cannot fill the gaping abyss which inhabits me - no, which IS me. I find my mind is plagued with questions which I have no solutions to everyday. Some people find fulfilment in relationships and personal improvement. However it is something I cannot envision myself having - let's say 10 years onward. I know will continue to keep myself occupied with games and false fulfilment online, just like I've always done. 

I fully acknowledge that putting yourself out there, meeting new people, and partaking in social activities takes guts. And from time to time I will do just that, put on a performance, or a mediocre imitation. In a way, every single one of us are impostors, imitations from the influences in our lives, some learn to eventually live it naturally, as we all can in fact. But for a mediocre actor like myself, the performance has its limits. 

The reality is I am lucky and privileged and yet I unconsciously betray these opportunities handed to me, ungratefully and undeserving.

Either I need to check myself into a mental health care facility ASAP, or I need to go somewhere private and secluded and opt out completely, or I'm pathetic and scared and lazy and I need to shut up and get over it and go stretch a smile on and go eat with other people and then hold the smile in place for Black Friday.

6482,"The possibility of committing suicide is bigger than I thoughtI used to think I could never be capable of suicide, no matter how much I suffered. There were too many possibilities and steps I would need to take to even consider it. I feared I would wake up in a hospital and, everyone would know I tried to kill myself. I feared not succeeding and act as if nothing happened. I thought one suicide note wouldn't be enough to explain everything and provide closure for people. So I would write individual ones to the people who need it the most. By my standards, it was more trouble than it was worth. 

  But now, those don't seem to matter anymore. I can't cry on my own so, I write suicide notes to make me cry for a release. I become so overwhelmed by negative thoughts that I would do anything to make them stop. I stopped self-harming for 4 years and, I recently relapsed to lift some of my emotional burdens. Last time I made myself stop on my own but, I don't think I can do that again. My impulsivity is out of control. I constantly have the urge to hurt myself and, in those moments suicide doesn't seem so far out of reach. The thought of not waking up the next day seems like a blessing. I am terrified of myself and what I might do. I am hoping I can get through this again on my own, but I am so exhausted. 

 I know I should talk to someone, but I am ashamed of myself. I don't want anyone in my personal life, knowing how much I am struggling.

The only way it could get worse is my parents dying which I would easily take my life if that happened right now. I am struggling financially which has affected my depression because I would like to get help but you have to have money to get help.

I have been trying for so long to find a new job but I haven't found anything. I went to college, got my bachelors, and have been busting my ass to find something decent.

Even the things I have in life that normally keep me happy have made me miserable (my hobbies, my fiance, my job). The stress and depression has taken a toll on my physical well-being. My body feels like a lump of flesh being held up by the little bit of will I have left to live. I just don't know how much more I can take.

I tried getting into internships, but they kept telling me my knowledge was lacking too much. That's because I only got a little from everything....

I still have a few shifts, but I don't think I can do it anymore. I tried so damn hard , thinking I can become independant, I got a shit degree with nothing I can do with, no experience and my work is too crap anyways nobody will hire me or take me on...

Before I broke up with my ex, all 4 of us were supposed to go camping for a week in July. Like, get dropped off by a ranger on an island, no buildings/water/food other than what you bring type camping. I was really psyched about it. After the break up, my friend told me they were bringing my ex since they think he could benefit more from having something to look forward to.


I'm not sure I'll be able to survive that week. It sucks enough that I got dis-invited to something I was really looking forward to, even if I understand my friend's reasoning. I'm going to be completely without my support structure for that whole week though. I have nothing to look forward to. A really shitty part of me just wants to disappear while they're gone and never turn back up again.

2754,"Too Scared to Die, Too Tired to Live. (A rant, I guess?)Hey, I don’t know if the title makes sense.. but here you go. You know depression, lows and highs and lows and highs, a never ending vicious cycle. I’m in one of the lows lately. Haven’t showered in a week (usually one every two days is my schedule), house is a mess for the last 2 months (haven’t cleaned once) and I feel truly bad. I don’t want to live anymore NOT because I see no hope for my future (I do, truly) but because I feel like even on my happiest days, I will struggle with depression and even the idea is making me exhausted. Almost like I am completely taken over by darkness but here is the thing.. I will never kill myself even though I want to stop existing everyday. Everyday I wish I wasn’t present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well.

14858,"Wish I could cease to exist.Here is an in depth article on my personal experience of depression and anxiety and how it came to be - [here.](https://kayderella.co.uk/2017/08/11/dread/)

tl;dr - I started with panic attacks due to phobia of vomiting, it escalated to general anxiety and OCD, then had my son which caused post-natal depression on top of the other mental health issues.

I feel like recently it is one bad thing after another and I can't seem to pick myself up. I made the decision to hand over primary care of my son to my Mum come January so he could attend nursery and be a little more normal but my friends have expressed great distaste for this and think it best he remains under my care.


I have had three mental break downs in as many weeks and considered suicide but have always stopped myself because I can't imagine someone having to explain to my three year old why he would never see me again. This breaks my heart to write but I just want him to be happy and I can't help but feel I will some how mess him up.


I just feel like I'm not enough for him. I barely get by and because of my anxiety and depression I don't have great prospects for work. I'd like to work from home but I don't have any talents that stand out or I can afford to work on.
Every time I speak with friends or my Mum it comes across as though I'll somehow be cured and things will go back to normal but I can't see myself ever being normal again. I can't imagine not living in fear of germs.

1931,"A Meaningless RantHonestly, I don’t know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn. 

I have no goals, I’m a Christian without faith and can’t find the point to living anymore. I’m 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day “what’s the point of being here?” I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isn’t a new question, it’s been haunting me for about 6 years and I don’t know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesn’t help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they’re necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

I’m just taking a random course to begin with so I don’t even know why I’m even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

It’s not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it’s a privilege. But I just can’t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don’t know how my friends or non-family would take it

I’ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal 2 weeks ago they took it well, a bit too calmly idk, nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse

I am struggling to keep up with all the assignments from the teacher, suffocating inside the workload. I have been skipping out on most of my readings to keep up with the work, going into the questions blind.

As well as suffering from the pressures of school, I suffer socially. I've been called ugly my whole life, and I get stares from people walking down the street. With severe social anxiety, this is crippling. It's gotten to a point where I don't feel comfortable walking outside in fears of people laughing at how ugly I am. I honestly think of myself as being the most hideous being that ever existed in the world. I was bullied for so long, and I have no friends, I am alone.

11427,"My Story / I Don’t Want to Be Here AnymoreHello, my name is Calvin. I’m a 16 year old kid and I think I’m done, for good this time.

As far as my backstory, I don’t know where to start. I grew up well, had good parents, and being an only child, I ended up being spoiled as fuck, looking back I wish I wasn’t as it played into some bad mindsets later down the road but never mind that, as I grew up, life never had many issues until the early teen years and onwards.

Since then was an absolute downwards spiral, there started my porn addiction, loss of friends, lack of connection with everyone in my life, lack of desire for anything, on the flipside when age 15 hit, the drive struck to turn all of it around, since that point I started working on quitting my bad habits and made progress, I have reconnected with friends, I have started working on music that makes me feel fulfilled more than ever.

Looking back on this year, the most things have happened this year than any point in my life despite the pandemic. What went wrong? Ever since three days ago, something happened, it was like the energy got zapped out of me. Not just mentally, but physically aswell. Usually when I hit a low point, there’s always some sort of big spark that arises that inspires me to get back up again. That spark hasn’t arrived.

I’ve tried everything in my power to build the momentum again: Better sleep, eating healthier, working out, everything that used to revive me in the past, nothing. Nothing is working. I genuinely feel like my soul does not have the power to get back up again this time, for good. At this point I’m looking for a quick way to end it.

14211,"Building a sensory deprivation tank (at home) for cuties. Sensory deprivation tanks are real things used by real people. They are meant for the purpose of cutting yourself off from reality basically. Most of the time they are incredibly relaxing and can give you a pretty awesome experience (not always, there are some people who have negative experiences). How they work is by cutting you off from light, sound, touch, and even gravity can be an incredibly relaxing an therapeutic experience. Athletes, spas, and more use these tanks for relaxation. Make sure you are not alone if you do try this. Seriously NOT ALONE. 


Alright here’s the fun part
- First, you will need somewhere to put all the water. A large inflatable pool should do the trick
- Secondly, you will need to fill it up about 10 inches high full of water or 150 gallons.
- Thirdly, you need Epsom Salts, 800 pounds for that amount of water. Gotta be careful because people might think you have an addiction to bath salts. 
- Fourth, make sure you kiss the pool and say love you because y’all gotta make it feel special and you are cuties so win win

After this happens you should be able to float successfully in the pool. You can do it in the tub but you won’t be able to stretch out as much. Make sure if you try doing it more then once you replace the salts. You can also add things to maximize your experience such as a blindfold, ear plugs, black out curtains, etc. This might sound familiar, such as the tank they built in stranger things but I promise it will be nothing like that. Even if you don’t have a mind blowing experience just taking a moment to be fully aware of your thoughts and not worrying about anything else can still be fun. Thank you for coming to my TED talk and have a great day my darlin’s!

14514,"Feeling intense emotional pain or intense indifference towards life, myself and others24/M

I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything. Nor have I visited a doctor. I am not on any medications...  

Every day the first thought in my head when I wake up is ""Why am I still alive?"" or ""I wish I was dead"".

I am just so emotionally drained and overwhelmed with sadness, yearning, regret, guilt, disappointment, frustration, heartbreak, isolation, loneliness, hopelessness, emptiness and confusion. It repeats itself too. I feel that or this from the aforementioned. And it's never better. I can't take this anymore. Seriously I can't. It's a cycle I've been in for past few months. I am just beating myself up and destroying myself at this point, and I want to stop feeling anything because that cycle is all I feel. This is no way to live...

And when it's not the aforementioned cycle - it's just an intense indifference towards myself, others and life in general. I just feel blank and emotionless. Not sad, happy, angry or anything. Just blank. But I feel most suicidal in this state of mind because I feel suicide seems to be most practical rather than ""emotionally induced"" and/or out of pain. I know that sounds quite odd. When in this state of mind, I simply think ""I have/need to die"" rather than ""I want to die"".

I would of killed myself long ago if it weren't for the fear of the actual physical pain or coming out brain damaged/deformed/etc. from fucking up killing myself - That's it. It's fucking pathetic.

11067,"Crying in Geometry - Cheaters just got wrecked # Average test scores over ZOOM was 87.

My school opened up two weeks ago giving us the option of continuing distance learning or going back to the actual school. We got back our first test yesterday.

# Average score was 25

Our Geometry teacher sent 19 of the 25 students to the in school suspension (ISS) room where the vice principal would be waiting for them to discuss the consequences and their very limited options.  Their parents would be informed of their ISS and why they were there.  That's when the tears started to flow. 

TIL found out what the immediate consequences and their options were:

* Consequences were that those students aren't allowed to try out for Spring sports next week and could not participate in any extracurricular activities or clubs like drama or band.  

* Options were to drop out of Geometry and go to Summer school 20+ miles away in Atlanta.  No transportation provided. Or they could repeat Geometry next year.  

Some parents of those kids are threatening to sue the school and are blaming the school, not their kid.  Parents are mad that more extra help and make up work isn't being offered.  So make up work was offered and that was to re do every homework assignment and test going back to the beginning of the year.  Extra help was always and is still offered for 45 minutes after school every day.  

* My three closest friends and I chose not to go back to school and we're still distance learning, but because we did well on the test other parents accused us and the two other students of cheating which we weren't and the school could prove it because since we had the option of going back to school and most kids chose to school, we were told to position our camera so the teacher could see us actually working out each problem.",non-suicide,"crying in geometry  cheaters just got wrecked  average test scores over zoom was 87  my school opened up two weeks ago giving us the option of continuing distance learning or going back to the actual school we got back our first test yesterday   average score was 25 our geometry teacher sent 19 of the 25 students to the in school suspension iss room where the vice principal would be waiting for them to discuss the consequences and their very limited options  their parents would be informed of their iss and why they were there  that s when the tears started to flow  til found out what the immediate consequences and their options were   consequences were that those students aren t allowed to try out for spring sports next week and could not participate in any extracurricular activities or clubs like drama or band    options were to drop out of geometry and go to summer school 20 miles away in atlanta  no transportation provided or they could repeat geometry next year   some parents of those kids are threatening to sue the school and are blaming the school, not their kid  parents are mad that more extra help and make up work isn t being offered  so make up work was offered and that was to re do every homework assignment and test going back to the beginning of the year  extra help was always and is still offered for 45 minutes after school every day    my three closest friends and i chose not to go back to school and we re still distance learning, but because we did well on the test other parents accused us and the two other students of cheating which we weren t and the school could prove it because since we had the option of going back to school and most kids chose to school, we were told to position our camera so the teacher could see us actually working out each problem ",327

I don't wanna try ruin everything for her. I just wanna be friends with her as I like her personality. But I have no clue how to go on.

I mean she has a bf. What could I do? I still think she gave me hints but I'm not 100% sure bout that. 

We sat next to each other in driving school and she kinda stared at me when I wasn't looking. I then asked her for her Snapchat and I got it. She smiled the whole time when we were talking etc. 

Next day (yesterday) we were learning how to drive a moped and whatever. Some things happened. The teacher and I were in a office bc I don't have my own helmet yet and I could borrow one. And then she came in and we smiled at each other. 

So when we were making ready for driving she asked me to help her with putting on her gloves.
Like that I thought was obviously a hint.

Then after i was standing there and she was sitting on a chair and she zoomed in to my face and took a picture on snapchat. Then even after when i was sitting next to her she took another picture and we laughed and everything. 

I don't wanna lose her.. I feel something like this for the first time man.

What should I do. I wanna be together with her but don't really wanna ruin her relationship. She even said she was together with the best guy.

12768,"My cousin killed himself 3 months ago, and it's made me think about my own suicidal tendencies.Let me begin by saying that I haven't actively tried to kill myself in years.  I used to self harm too, but I guess you can say I've replaced one vice with another (frequent self-induced vomiting).

I know that my cousin tried to kill himself about 15 years ago, wasn't successful, and was hospitalized.  I know that he suffered from depression.  And I never reached out to him.  I was so focused on my own problems that I never tried to help him through his own.  I feel immense guilt over it, but here I am thinking about my problems again.

After my cousin killed himself, a lot of old feelings I had about my father's passing (he died from brain cancer) 3 years ago resurfaced.  I can't help but mourn both my cousin (who in a way was like a big brother to me) and my father all over again.  I feel selfish for thinking about myself and how I have put people through so much crap with my self harming/vices and suicidal tendencies.

I miss them both so much.  It doesn't help that my family is keeping his suicide a secret, either.  I have to lie to people and say he had a work-related injury, which is such bullshit.  They're keeping it a secret to ""protect"" his grandma from the truth.  One of the harder things I've done was lie to her when she pulled me aside and asked me ""what really happened to him"" because the story didn't add up--she isn't stupid.

I feel so overwhelmed.  I'm going to see a doctor about my vomiting next week so hopefully I'll get on the right track to recovery for myself.  I just wish it wasn't too late for my cousin.",suicide,"my cousin killed himself 3 months ago, and it s made me think about my own suicidal tendencies let me begin by saying that i haven t actively tried to kill myself in years  i used to self harm too, but i guess you can say i ve replaced one vice with another frequent self induced vomiting  i know that my cousin tried to kill himself about 15 years ago, wasn t successful, and was hospitalized  i know that he suffered from depression  and i never reached out to him  i was so focused on my own problems that i never tried to help him through his own  i feel immense guilt over it, but here i am thinking about my problems again  after my cousin killed himself, a lot of old feelings i had about my father s passing he died from brain cancer 3 years ago resurfaced  i can t help but mourn both my cousin who in a way was like a big brother to me and my father all over again  i feel selfish for thinking about myself and how i have put people through so much crap with my self harming/vices and suicidal tendencies  i miss them both so much  it doesn t help that my family is keeping his suicide a secret, either  i have to lie to people and say he had a work related injury, which is such bullshit  they re keeping it a secret to protect his grandma from the truth  one of the harder things i ve done was lie to her when she pulled me aside and asked me what really happened to him because the story didn t add up she isn t stupid  i feel so overwhelmed  i m going to see a doctor about my vomiting next week so hopefully i ll get on the right track to recovery for myself  i just wish it wasn t too late for my cousin ",326
13111,"I've broached the taboo of suicideThis all started a long time ago. I'm 23 now and have spent the last 6 years with major depression. Just now, typing this out, I've come to the realization that that is over 1/4th of my life it has sucked the joy away from. 1/4 of my life...

My dad died when I was in high-school. I never dealt with the thousands of issues that arose as a result of that. There was a...terrible accident and he was dead. In the blink of an eye. In a way I hate him for it. But I love him. And I miss him. There were things he could have done to prevent it, but he was over-confident and now I don't have a father. My family never really healed. It was not supposed to be this way. It was not supposed to fucking be this way.

Recently this has gotten worse, or maybe it is only a temporary low. I'm not sure of anything. I live with my girlfriend but rarely see her. Our work schedules conflict. I'm on nights, which seems to be fuel to the fire of my depression. I'm not sure what's changed, but it's been all I can do not to have a full blown mental breakdown at work. 

My thoughts have run dark. They say: You could kill yourself. You are worthless. They all hate you anyway. Why not? What's the point anyway? Look at how far you still need to go! All you do is toil away in obscurity not even worthy of mention. They will not remember you. They will not miss you. You are worthless and pathetic. Everything is worthless.

So here I was doing all these chores working full time and supporting her so that she could go to school and not let her mother and family hold her back (21f). So we always went back and fourth about monogamy and I’m very I wanna get married and spend the rest of my life with her and she was like I want to live alone with a dog.

6601,"Ugly 29 year old man leaving on a suicide trip in a few days.Here is my long story, short. I am a 29 year old man, who has had suicidal ideations for the last 5 years. My biggest issue is living in self induced isolation that I deal with everyday all day. I really want relationships, but I hate the way I look, and because of that I have abandoned all my previous relationships, and hardly leave the house anymore. I have social anxiety, but it is brought about by self consciousness over my appearance. I also have a very young looking appearance, and because of that I have had a hard time getting ahead in my personal, and professional life in the past. 

On Sunday I am leaving the town that I currently live in, and going on a suicide trip in hopes that I can have a little bit of fun (if my depression will allow) so that I can end my sad existence on a somewhat high note. I plan on going surfing, losing my virginity to a hooker, and visiting several National Parks I have never been to. My plan is to travel around for a few days, and then buy a gun, and shoot myself in an isolated area outdoors where no one will witness the scene. I do not want anyone to witness my suicide, and I wish I could avoid someone stumbling upon my dead body, but that is unavoidable. 

I am not posting this to be talked out of my plan, because I cannot be. This plan is five years in the making. My life is not getting any better, and I would have terminated myself sooner, but I knew my Mother would be very hurt by it.

6880,"Advice from a girl, about girls In the past few days I have seen posts about boys giving advice about dating boys and I’m female and I thought I’d give it a shot. English is not my native language so I’m sorry if there are spelling and grammar mistakes. Also I might have forgotten a few things, so feel free to make your own post with things that I forgot 

A lot of girls are very insecure about themselves, especially because of/during  puberty, so it’s feels really good to be complimented and reassured that we don’t look like a mess.

You should try to be as friendly as possible. A lot of people say that nice guys finish last but that’s not true. It’s very refreshing to have an actually nice person. It’s great if your SO is also like your best friend. Someone who is understanding and always there for you.

We like affection but we are often afraid that we’re too clingy. It’s great if you hug us first or a little kiss on a cheek, it can literally make our day. We also don’t even need sex, it’s completely overrated. A lot of girls are super afraid of their first time and show her or tell her that you can wait for her until she’s ready.

You should try to find out what a girls interests are, you don’t need to pretend to love it but at least show a little interest. I think it’s super attractive when a guy is interested in the same things as me. 

I also have something that you should try to avoid. Please don’t send anyone dick pics without consent, there is just no good ducking angle for that.

16210,"Overwhelmed and LostI have a great wife, amazing friends, supportive family, yadda yadda yadda, but I feel awful regularly. At 29, I've dealt with this for longer than I can remember. Suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and a general feeling that my world is slowly crashing around me run through my head, and they become self fulfilling. I shut myself away from my patient, caring wife and make her feel lonely and she deserves nothing of what I give her. It feels like I've trapped her in this shit life of mine and she can't get out for fear of me doing something foolish like end it all. I don't have plans, but I constantly think about death. I don't fear it. As some one who thinks about it as often as I do, I almost welcome it. A car crash or crazy fuck with an AK shooting up my place of work sound comforting.   

I've let my depression stop me from being a good person. My wife recently lost some one extremely close to her to cancer and during her grieving period I was distant and closed off. I can be an asshole a lot of the time, but as I look back on how I acted, I feel a sense of shame I have never felt before. I don't want to tell her about my suicidal thoughts, because I don't think she can handle losing some close to her so soon. I refrain from acting on my thoughts because the reality is that the people around me care so much that their lives would be seriously impacted. And I love them all so much that I couldn't do that to them. But I'm afraid that at some point I may reconsider and be selfish old me again. Seeking professional help is confusing, complicated, and downright expensive.

10488,"I think I finally have the ability to do it.There’s a point on my commute where you merge onto a different highway and there’s 3 empty lanes overlooking a big field far below. Sometimes I like to play chicken with myself and close my eyes and see how far I can drift across the lanes until I get too scared. 

I’ve always had one-off thoughts of suicide since my childhood, but this year has really pushed me further and further to the point where I have daily fantasies about killing myself. I don’t think anyone has ever fully understood who I am and what I go through, and people I have tried to open up to are always unwilling to accept that I’m mentally ill or pushed away by me. 

I’ve had constant chills through the past months. My anxiety and depression are wrecking my health and my ability to be a productive person. I can’t focus on tasks or achieve anything of worth. It’s hard to go outside. I’m at the age of applying for college and I’ve barely done anything because I don’t believe that I’ve ever had anything worth developing. I’m a failure. Everyone around me is unaware of my thoughts, and I’m worthless compared to all of them. My only worth has been accrued through what I’ve done for others; looking back, it’s like I’ve never been my own person at all. 

I don’t think anyone really knows me as a person. There’s nothing to care about anyways.

Came to them today to have a family dinner tomorrow and they do nothing but arguing between each other over stupid shit. Guess they are so tired of each other they ain’t even faking it.

Yesterday I had a birthday party with my friends. Of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some Dopamine™️ through people I considered friends. We live together and I try to do shit that would bind me with them. Simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someone’s sick or stuff. But there’s no feedback. When I ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (don’t know how it’s called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. Asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them “Whoops, sorry, guess I forgot”. 

Same with my work. I’m treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit I ask them to do and rely on. 

I feel completely alone. Not like *alone* but with no person I can rely to. My close ones make me sick. Social interaction makes me sick. My work makes me sick. My constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. My corrupted country makes me sick. The whole world makes me sick. And now there’s some weird Chinese virus which literally makes people sick.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can.

13696,"Chronic illness is way too much for me to handle. Need advice on humane way to go, please.Repost per redGPz's advice. Thank you, friend.
---
I've had a chronic illness for the last 8 years - symptoms include extreme unrelenting fatigue, terribly distressing digestive issues, muscle pain, constant headache, confusion, blurry vision, sensitivity to strong smells and feeling as if I'm 'daydreaming' constantly.

Depression and anxiety disorders have been ruled out multiple times by multiple doctors. So have common digestive disorders such as Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis, Diverticulitis, Celiac's and others. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, MS and other autoimmune disorders tested negative. The only vitamin/mineral I was deficient in was D, but I've taken nearly 250,000 IU's (yes, you've read that correctly) in the last year without help.

The only diagnosis I've received is Chronic Fatigue, teetering on Fibromyalgia.

Several doctors have taken me off any form of pharmaceuticals, including aspirin due to severe reactions to medication. I've tried a HELL of a lot of alternative/holistic treatment which helps very temporarily but doesn't last.

I owe thousands of dollars trying to support myself through this illness (can't work much because I was too sick) and I'm too tired to keep trying to pay it off - it's been there for years and hasn't moved. It's only $4,000, but after years of trying to pay it off only for it to 'stay' feels insurmountable.

Please, somebody tell me an encouraging story about your chronic illness or direct me to a humane way of ending this. I don't want to do this any more.

Edit: Obviously a throw-away account.

Suicide has been around for a while in my life. The last attempt was a few years ago, and it really fucked me up. My family doesn't know about it..

Since then, I think about what pain my death would cause my mom. It helps cause I don't want to hurt her. I live because I love her, but after she's gone... I'm not sure yet.

Tonight I'm thinking about what I'll be leaving behind. Who I'll be remembered as.

Thing is... I'm at peace with what I think they'd say. 

I try to be a good person. Being told I was a narcissist by a professional changed my life completely that way. I no longer just think I'm a good person, I try to be. Cause I want to be one. Those closest to me know this about me, and they know I've come a long way.

I'd be weak in their eyes, but I am. There's so much I could have done, but I don't think I'll ever be able to. I've talked friends down from their darkest moments, tried to give them advice I've learned for living a better life, but in the end wasn't strong enough... I'm at peace with them able to think these things.

615,"It's just one more monthHey,

Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.

To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.

Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.

After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.

After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.

In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.

I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

4855,"Told Everyone I Want to Die; Still Want to DieIt just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom. Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks. A few days later, during an anxiety attack, a friend messaged me and I impulsively told her that I've been suicidal for the past year and that I was having a mental breakdown. 

And now I'm telling you, internet stranger.

I'm not sure what I expected to get out of telling people. I guess I was looking for some reason to live to just hit me, but it hasn't. 

Now I just feel more trapped than ever. 

If I kill myself now, I'm going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt. My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. 

I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. 

I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything.

It feels doomed. I don't know how to interact with people anymore. Nothing is enough. I thought seeing my friends would help, it didn't. It just reminded me how lonely I am. All of my problems are unsolvable because they're not even real problems. They're just me. I need to be loved, just a fucking hug, anything, but I can't ask for help from anyone I actually know. I go back to work in 2 days and I know I can't do my fucking job anymore. I'm snapping. I've been snapping for months and it's finally happening. Help.

She sauntered into the room, her enormous breasts swaying from side-to-side like a great grandfather clock, glistening enticingly, her massive nipples clinging to the underside of the latex bra she just happened to be wearing at 2 PM on a Monday evening.

The throbbing mounds that adorned her colossal melons seemed as if to emit a high-pitched grown. A dog whistle of sorts. A siren call that made my 18-inch penis immediately stand at attention like a marine in the dog house.

I stumbled over to her, my massive shaft swaying from side-to-side, rocking the whole house with it. Upon closer inspection, her giant conkers were even more impressive that I'd first thought. Sprinkled lightly with freckles, like a perfectly peppered biscuit, she had the most beautiful bongos I'd ever gazed upon.

I let out a primal yell and immediately entered her, causing her to spout cum violently before completing the first thrust. We were still clothed. Such was the power of my immense man meat that I penetrated her clothing and simultaneously found entrance to her clitoris. Like climbing some massive mossy meat mountain, I erected my shaft at the top and declared victory. This wasn't my first sexual encounter. I've had sex with at least 9 other women. Still, something about this one was special.

Still inside her, I could feel her ovaries trembling. My gigantic cock had curled inside her like fruit by the foot, now spurting from her mouth as if a great cum-fountain. 

""You like that bebe?"" I grumbled.

Her nipples gazed at me with lust and thirst.

5431,"I think some people here might be able to help others... idk but it’s a thoughtThis might get me kicked off the community; however, I think that a few others here might be able to help others out here.

I saw a few posts of people who are wealthy yet don’t really have a reason to live because they did something stupid like reason X and now don’t think they are worth redemption. On the other side there are people who feel really screwed by their financial circumstances like not being able to pay a months rent.  

I know this sounds stupid but just hear me out can’t like people who are wealthy give a little money to those who really need it. I mean charity does help to reduce symptoms of depression, give a little sense of empowerment as you are able to help someone, and might act as a reason to continue ( like for a short while ) and this may help the former. As for the later I think this financial support just might be the thing to pull them out of this situation. 

Yes I understand rent is not always chip change but I am not asking you to give the entire amount like even small amounts. 
I mean yes it’s stupid but hey just think about if. Also sorry if I somehow insulted someone in any manner 

Note: I am 17 m and did some charity work a few months back [ went to some remote area and taught a student for a while]  and I can say that was probably the best 2 weeks of my life.

Today, he got angry with me for making a joke that I’d leave him for Ellen page. He said, as revenge, that he’d leAve me for his ex. As a joke. Then he did his usual of going to bed.

I’m trying so hard to make everybody happy. I’m trying to get through college, I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didn’t. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and I’m sick of it.

I’ve had two abortions I didn’t want to have because my boyfriend wanted me to. Throughout the first one, he was constantly telling me to leave him alone. I was constantly depressed for three months after, and he would always tell me to leave if I was going to act like that. The second one, he didn’t do that as much, but I wasn’t as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think I’m ready to leave now. After he said he’d leave me for his ex I just thought... I’ve never thought to joke about that, I’ve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isn’t true? 

So I think I’m done. I’m done trying. I’ve tried for thirteen years to get better and I’m tired. I can’t handle a job. I can’t handle school. I can’t even handle my boyfriend who I’ve been with for nearly six years.

And all I keep doing is relapsing into something. It's dark and it's like falling into a pit.


This past week has been hard. I keep telling myself I am happy, I really have nothing to be sad about. But everything still feels so hopeless and pointless. In the middle of work last night I texted him, thinking maybe talking about it would help. He was as helpful and supportive as I could ask for.


Yet still when I clocked out at 7am I walked down to the freeway and thought about it, and after some time I walked to the park down the street instead and called him, crying. He came and got me and took care of me. I stopped feeling for a while. Just felt numb. I watched him play TFT, and laughed a little. But nothing felt real. Like I was a shell.


All I can think about is why. Why can't I be okay. Why do I just constantly feel like just. Ending it. I come back out of the pit after a while and I can feel again, like right now. I don't want to drag him down with me. I don't want him to hurt because I can't fix myself, at least right now. He just tells me he cares about me, and he wants to do what he can to help.

I won't swim in the sea either, that's something my mom hates. 

I got depression and mayor anxiety one and a half year ago because I found out that I'm a lesbian, but my family didn't handle the news well when I came out to them. After that, I fell head over heals in love with a classmate, my best friend. She was okay with it, but I became slightly unstable because of hormones and being in love, which caused mom to scream at me, in front of my family ""You're a psycho!"" it hurt me a lot, since I was extra vulnerable to comments. I had many sights of me swimming further and further out in the sea until I drowned, or jumping from a tall cliff to end it, but I'm scared of self harm.

6328,"My friends are looking down on me and telling me to kill myselfOkay, so the title is probably making you wonder what kind of asshole ""friends"" I have.

Well, I should probably mention that I used to make jokes about depression and my suicidal tendencies in an attempt to deal with my problems, just the way /r/2meirl4meirl does it, for example. Turns out that that kind of humor works better on the internet than in real life though.

I'm not actually sure if my classmates were worried about me in the beginning but I know that they're just annoyed that I'm always down at this point.

The other day two of my classmates told me that I should just finally go and kill myself, if I'm really as unhappy as I am but that I probably won't do it anyways because I'm ""too big of a pussy after all"".

I get that they probably don't mean it. I don't want to make it sound like I'm being bullied. People like me and they were just goofing around but they honestly don't know what they're saying. I was legit considering it. I always am.

I stopped joking about depression. I stopped talking about not feeling too well or being down. I'll never talk about how I'm doing anymore. I'll always be ""fine"", because as soon as you tell someone that you're not really doing well, they just tell you that you should suck it up and stop being a wuss.

I hate this. I wish I never showed them that I'm not happy. I should have never tried to reach out by making stupid jokes about depression. Real life is not like the internet.

6735,"Why I can't just talk about suicide?I mean... It's obvious. But I just with I could tell people as a ""warning"" so they can prepare themselves. I don't want attention at all, for real! I know that losing someone hurts and have the knowledge that the person's not gonna be there soon may allow you to not suffer so much or not be surprised.
Like, when people have some deadly disease the doctor warn the family. Why can't I tell them?

Maybe you're thinking that I want to say that bc I want them to treat me better or just get more attention, but honestly, the thing is that I don't wanna die in vain (though I'm going to) and perhaps the ones that'll stick around learn something or try to be better ppl. 

I've been planning my death for 3/4 years now, and I feel like I lived enough. Went to therapy for a month or so and didn't really helped (my parents don't like the thought that I may not be healthy, so they just avoid it). I'll die in December 2021 if I make it through this year.

Don't feel pity, don't feel pain, don't feel anything. It's not like I'm the only one who's gonna leave, I'm not important and don't wanna be. Didn't have a good life but wasn't that bad too. The only thing that I don't like about it is that there are so many ppl in way worst situations than me and they're still trying.

I'm just tired, haven't done my best and ain't ready to live like a real adult, so f*ck it.

Tomorrow I will be 24. I attend Eating Recovery Center(ERC)- Insight Chicago and I've been there in the BETTR PROGRAM , program designed for BED.

12137,"18 year old girl about to be homelessI left an abusive household where my parents (especially my dad) sexually abused me for years. Around the time I turned 18, my dad would try to get me to sell my body to him in exchange for money. 

My last straw was hearing my parents talking about sending me off to the middle east and marrying me off. When I left, I had no money, no legal documents, no family and no friends.

 I've been living in a homeless shelter since November, and the staff told me they wouldn't kick me out until I found a place to stay, but things have changed and they're kicking me out on the 29th. 

I have section 8 and for weeks after I applied for an apartment, the staff told me not to get a job and to focus on housing first. The apartment didn't work out and now I have no job and no housing. I did apply for another section 8 apartment, but its a big maybe.

I've told the people close to me that i'll be alright, but it's just me putting up a facade.

I don't know what will happen to me. I have a friend who would be willing to let me crash, but I would only be able to stay for a couple of days because of his lease.

Being out on the streets is scary, the amount of creepy comments/solicitation of prositution made towards me frightens me, and I'm not even on the streets right now.

15338,"Worried about my friend who feels hopelessHey guys, I just reached out to one of my friends (20) on snap that I met while gaming a while back. I asked him how everything is going and that I haven’t heard from him in some time.

He responded with: “Everything sucks, like everything is terrible.” And after asking him if he could elaborate and that I was willing to lend an ear, he replied “Literally everything. Every aspect of my life is shit. There’s a lot. And honestly at this point I’m just gonna give up.” After several attempts at trying to console him and tell him to talk to me about it and that all is not lost, he finally gave in.

He’s broke, is driving a car that’s on “borrowed time”, and his unemployment registration was investigated and withheld because he was using a vpn when he registered and his IP location was in Sweden. He has since cleared things up with unemployment but still has to wait some time before they pay him again. He’s said he may try to take a loan out soon which I fear could make his situation worse if he doesn’t have the funds to pay it back on time.

He has over $1200 in expenses currently. A large chunk of it for tickets and his rent. He’s been late on his rent 2 months in a row and I asked him if he’s spoken to his landlord about his situation to see if maybe things could be worked out there. He said he doubts it due to his latency. 

Any advice that I can give him from you guys? I don’t want to lose my friend. I can’t imagine the grief and worry that he’s dealing with right now and I don’t want him to take his own life because of it.

All help / advice would be greatly appreciated.",suicide,"worried about my friend who feels hopelesshey guys, i just reached out to one of my friends 20 on snap that i met while gaming a while back i asked him how everything is going and that i havent heard from him in some time  he responded with everything sucks, like everything is terrible  and after asking him if he could elaborate and that i was willing to lend an ear, he replied literally everything every aspect of my life is shit theres a lot and honestly at this point im just gonna give up  after several attempts at trying to console him and tell him to talk to me about it and that all is not lost, he finally gave in  hes broke, is driving a car thats on borrowed time , and his unemployment registration was investigated and withheld because he was using a vpn when he registered and his ip location was in sweden he has since cleared things up with unemployment but still has to wait some time before they pay him again hes said he may try to take a loan out soon which i fear could make his situation worse if he doesnt have the funds to pay it back on time  he has over 1200 in expenses currently a large chunk of it for tickets and his rent hes been late on his rent 2 months in a row and i asked him if hes spoken to his landlord about his situation to see if maybe things could be worked out there he said he doubts it due to his latency  any advice that i can give him from you guys? i dont want to lose my friend i cant imagine the grief and worry that hes dealing with right now and i dont want him to take his own life because of it  all help / advice would be greatly appreciated ",319

I just want to be one of those beautiful autistic people who doesn't look disabled in pictures, I want to be told ""but there's nothing wrong with you"" when I tell them I'm autistic, but instead I have people pointing out that I do look disabled before I mention that I am.  Having a visible disability is embarrassing and I never want to leave the house again.  Especially since most high functioning autistic girls look LESS disabled than neurotypical girls and I am on the low functioning end disappointed how I could have ended up modelling if my autism was mild.

I have never been told that I don't look disabled.  My disability is VISIBLE.  I literally have a different face and body shape.  On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.

I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled.  It's a COMPLIMENT to me.  It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded.  Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?  I'd rather just be told that I am too beautiful and intelligent to be disabled and not get any help whatsoever than be called retarded.

I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help. I can’t afford professional help though. I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk. Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to. 

My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident. When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing. I don’t want my parents to find me. I really don’t want to die. I don’t. And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid, I thought at least.

5840,"My viewSo I got married at 17, expected to be with that woman for the rest of my life.  After about 25 yrs, she decided to finally lose some weight and started with 200 lbs of ugly husband - no abuse, no infidelity, just boredom.  I lost everything - no house, no family, no job.

So after about 5 years I got my life pulled back together.  At this point I'm in my late 40's, meet another woman, get married, buy a house, etc.  Now a little backstory here - pretty much all my life I've had health problems.  My first heart attack was in 1990, I weighed 180, non smoker, social drinker, no family history, active in sports, etc.  No way I deserved it.  I think my depression started then.  I know that I have been afraid every day for the past 27 years.  Just for the record, there have been three heart attacks, several ""cardiac incidents"" and a stroke.  I take pills for diabetes, depression, heart issues.  There may be lung issues involved.  I left my job in October, 1/2 step ahead of being fired for missing so much time.  So I'm not in a good place physically or emotionally.

So, on Thanksgiving weekend I left the house angry, depressed, unhappy, etc and ended up buying a pistol.  On Sunday, my loving, understanding wife had the police take me to the hospital.  While I was in there she filed a temporary restraining order which just became permanent - police at the house on Christmas eve during a family party.  While we were in court for the restraining order, her lawyer mentioned that she has filed for divorce.

Now I'm 58, no job, finances a wreck, bad health, marriage over, no social life, leaching off my daughter's family.  I just can't see ANY way to pretend there's a reason for going on.

7555,"My cat is my suicide prevention tool &lt;3 - a pet could change your lifeI read this article in the Metro today and just thought about how true it was:
https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/30/therapy-cats-can-be-life-changing-for-people-with-mental-illness-7586768/

My cat isn't a ""therapy cat"" (tbh, I'm surprised anyone has managed to train a cat for an actual purpose) but is 100% the reason I am here today. I adopted him in 2014 during a very low period despite people telling me it ""wasn't the right time"". All I can say is that people know what is best for them and I needed something to love. Trust your own instincts.

He is the reason I get out of the bed in the morning, and the reason I go to work. He is there when I go to sleep and when I wake up. I've cried into his fur a thousand times and he soaks up my tears. I tell him he is my little baby and that I will always be here to look after him. And in making that promise, I know I have to be here for him. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving him alone.

There's simply no room to consider suicide now. He is my life. In time I will adopt more animals because I know when he passes it will hit me hard. But as long as I have something furry in my life to give my love to, it tethers me to this world.

Sometimes I might think I want to die, but mostly I know I don't want to die. My purring ball of fur reminds me every day that I can't just quit. He keeps me going.

My thoughts are commanding me to die. But when I cry, I start repetitively screaming “I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die”. I don’t know what I believe. I stopped caring about whether the neighbors can hear me.

I then grabbed my iPhone, my r/teenagers wallpaper shining bright under the morning sun. I opened Reddit and instantly went to my favourite subreddit, r/teenagers. It took a while for my internet to load. As I saw Reddit’s blue circle spinning round and round, my anticipation for seeing the quality content present in r/teenagers began to rise. And then my internet loaded, which changed my life forever.

#OFFICIAL r/TEENAGERS MERCH DROP!

This was the first thing I saw. I immediately dropped my phone and began hyperventilating. It took a few minutes to calm down, but I still get goosebumps thinking about how many virtual Reddit doors had opened up for me.

I grabbed my credit card. And then with my heartbeat soaring, I ordered everything on the site. I received a receipt in my e-mail shortly after. The feeling that the mod team behind r/teenagers had sent me a RECEIPT for their official r/teenagers merch made me cry tears of joy. I printed it out at a rapid paste and stuck it to my wall.

I am the #1 r/teenagers fan in the world. I have the sub’s official logo tattooed on my chest and one time a mod for the subreddit said “Good meme!!” when referring to my classic 2018 meme, which harshly criticised Instagram Fortnite normies.

1223,"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" — William Shakespeare

Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.

The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.

Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.

I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:

* Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
* The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
* They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.

The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.

Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

5078,"Everyone seems to think I am overreacting.A few weeks ago I got this contraceptive implant and no one prepared me for what it would be like. The doctor made the side effects sound like they were minor before sticking it in my arm. This thing is changing me, and my mood has been taking a plunge. I went to my doctor almost in tears and all she did was tell me to ""give it a chance"". This was after telling me that these side effects may last for 3 months. My boyfriend told me to be patient and that he knows I can do this. I went on the Nexplanon subreddit to try and find advice and their rules said that they don't want to hear from anyone who bashes the implant and is ""being a baby about"" the side effects.

5323,"My life wasn’t supposed to be this wayI’m sorry for the wall of text but maybe someone will read and might actually understand where I’m coming from

How did everything go so fucking wrong? I have a huge extended family who has shown me nothing but love my entire life. My parents love me too, but honestly sometimes I resent them for the emotional trauma they put me through when I was a kid. I have always been the scapegoat of the family, whenever something went wrong I was somehow to blame. Enduring this for years made me hollow, timid &amp; unsure of who I was. Middle school was hell, I had friends but I also received relentless bullying from a few people, which left me a fucking mess when it came time for high school. Freshman year of high school on the first day, a girl walks up to me and says “You know you’re socially awkward right?”. Fucking. Traumatizing. It wasn’t all bad though, freshman year I met the love of my life, (although we wouldn’t date until after high school)  and we were best friends all through high school. Besides her though, I would spend the next three years with almost no friends. I’ve made some terrible mistakes, shit that keeps me up at night. I’ve been a terrible son, brother, friend, boyfriend, and person. To cope with my constant existential anxiety I either use my phone, weed or drink to keep the suicidal thoughts away, but sometimes all three can make it worse. I can’t always be a good boyfriend to my girlfriend because of how suicidal I am, but I truly love her so much. I’m sorry if this is messy because I feel like I’m at the beginning of a dissociative episode.

I'm at a loss of what to do. I just am very tired of failing after trying so hard all the time. People say if you fall off the horse, just get back on, but at what point do you realize that maybe you're not made for riding horses. I'm just not good at dealing with people. I can't deal with women anymore. I've continually failed, and been rejected. I've tried to change seemingly everything. Worked out, and gotten in shape. I have a good job that makes good money. I try to be supportive while still being my own person. I used to have confidence but a string of unfaithful partners destroyed that. I just don't know what to do. I have loyal friends and good parents, but I no one ever loves me (in a romantic sense). I don't want to die, but I've just lost motivation to keep going. I've always tried to look at the bright side, but I don't see a way out. I started cutting again. I promised I'd never to that again, but I failed at that too. I do feel bad about the pain I will cause my family &amp;amp; friends, but I've lost all hope. After Christmas, I'm calling it quits. Thank you Reddit for helping me hang on a little longer than I would have otherwise. I don't want it to end this way! I'm so tired of being alone, but I can't feel alone if I'm dead.

650,"Had shotgun off safety, in my mouth today.I'm a targeted individual.  I've been tortured, followed (from city to city), slandered, attacked by every conceivable mental torture possible.  Hearing voices, seeing holograms, robbed of intellectual and physical property.  Too long to list.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

My sister called the cops on me a few months ago for being suicidal and telling her off.  I got a felon with a gun charge.  They can give me 5 to 40 years in prison.  I'm not going back to fucking prison.  I've been before and can't stand being around convicts who actually belong there.

And nobody ever apologized or feels any remorse for the things they do to me.

So I was going to do it today but everyone was coming over tonight, I was trying to hurry but scared.  I heard a noise, looked out the window, and it was my mom coming home from church.

So I'm waiting until I know for sure one of my nieces or nephews won't be here when they find me.

5745,"Tired of talking about it.I've been talking about suicide for many months, and I've felt suicidal for a few years. I went through a horrible divorce, and lost my whole life. I received a decent divorce settlement, but my will to live was vanquished. I have been unable to rebuild my life, and to get my shit together enough to support myself. In December, my alimony runs out. I drank away the majority of my house equity. My savings will only support me until March at the latest. I'm finished.

I've tried to build a new life with the woman I am dating. We've been seeing each other for many months now. But I don't think she wants what I am looking for, and I'll never get it from anyone. All I want is what I once had: living together with someone I love, building a life together, leaning on each other. I'll never get that again. It's all I need to focus; it is the drive I need to succeed. I am just one of those kinds of people who need the stability in order to flourish. I lack that stability, and I am failing.

The only person I can talk to about this is my divorce lawyer--attorney-client privilege. I called the suicide hotline back in July, and had 5 deputies visit where I am living, and took me to a clinic, where I was discharged 2 hrs later. (Never, ever call the suicide hotline.)

I applied to grad school but wasn't accepted. I work in retail, \~10-20 hours a week. I also work in a research lab \~5 hours a week. I get tired pretty easily. I'm feeling pretty useless from not being able to work much and not starting school this August.

I've been dealing with some paranoia and hearing voices since February, convinced my professors were out to get me... I was being watched, etc. Most of it is much better but now I'm feeling run down. I live with ptsd symptoms from childhood abuse. also basically living in a house with someone who reminds me of my childhood abuse. 

I do see a psychiatrist. working on my anxiety right now with a new med. I also see a therapist but not getting very far when I have frequent suicidal thoughts..

I think that sums up my life. I'm always researching suicide methods. I found one recently and have really taken to it. I'm planning it for the first day I'm home alone after I have all the tools. It'll be about 2-2.5 weeks, not by choice.

I don't know what I expect to get from posting.

I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left. Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy.

3987,"Trying to find a reason to go on.Hi. I never thought this would be my first post on reddit. To be honest I just got really depressed and googled what I felt and stumbled upon this thread. Probably a silly reason to join but I just really needed to talk to someone.

All my life I have been trained to focus on making good grades so I could go to college and get a job. I did well at that. I've got a full time job with benefits and I'm out on my own. And that's it. I feel like I've fulfilled all I've ever known as my purpose in life and everything seems completely pointless. To boot, I'm new in town and 90% of my friends live 3+ hours away. The ones that do live nearby flake out on hanging out almost every single time. One of my best friends said she'd try to move here after she graduates but it's apparent that's not going to happen. My long distance boyfriend promised the same but I seriously doubt that will happen either. And if we can't figure out a way to be together, he's already told me that'll be the end of it.  

So, I really don't have anything to look forward to. I've got no real goals to strive for, and even if I did, I barely have the energy to clean the apartment and make food for myself. I tried to confide in a friend last night but all he said was ""stop whining and do something you like""...

 I've been here before, and I know I probably won't actually kill myself, but the indifference I feel about going through with it kind of scares me. 

Hope this is okay. Thank you for reading.

4720,"The loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me. Ever since the lockdown, I've been gradually getting more and more detached from reality; all the games I play have now become boring, and having no contact with my friends really doesn't help.

As of writing, my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day. I always drift off at around 3-6 AM and then wake up at 3-6PM at the earliest and latest. As a result, my routine I'm trying to get to is ripped apart because of it.

I've been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage, and one of my siblings are convinced I'm suffering from Insomnia. I'm convinced it's getting worse by each passing night.

I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation. I'm not good with arts, writing, or music anymore, and the games I once enjoyed playing I've now grown more distant with each passing day, losing more motivation by each one.

I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up, I'll just go back to sleep again. And then the cycle will repeat itself.

School is not helping either; I can't cope with the online work given, especially since I only have one computer that is **not** used for playing games. As a result, I've given that up too.

I just can't cope with this lockdown any longer, and that's coming from a borderline introvert.

11319,"Please helpHello, I'm posting this on behalf of a loved one (my girlfriend). I am in my late teens and she is in her early twenties.

 She has an incurable condition which causes her constant chronic pain and in many respects makes her life crap. She is also extremely depressed and will talk about suicide with me quite openly. She quite often expresses the desire to jump off a cliff or purchase a firearm and shoot herself with it (I live in the UK so this would be pretty hard). She hasn't made any attempts recently but I know that she has jumped off of a building before and that she has tried overdosing on codeine painkillers on more than one occasion. She says that she doesn't want to live (even if her disease is cured) because the part of her that cared about living died a long time ago. She says that she is trying to think of a method of killing herself that will be 100% effective that will leave no chance of her becoming a vegetable on life support for the rest of her life. I have tried numerous times to get her some help be it from therapy or anti-depressants but she has none of it.

After 2-3 years of this I reached my wits end today and told her sister and father all about it because I genuinely feared for her life. I know I did the right thing and hope that they can get her some help but she seems so far gone to me. She also found out about me telling and said that she can never trust me with anything again and for a moment wanted to never speak with me again.

13141,"""Just get help.""I'm so fucking sick of being told to just get help every time I express difficulties coping with mental illness. As if getting help is an instant, permanent solution to all of the difficulties of being alive when you don't want to be.

I am now 24. I've been in treatment consistently since I was suicidal at age 8. I've been in psychiatric hospitals, and I've been in outpatient programs that were full time and limited my ability to work or go to school for years in the past. I've been to good therapists, and I've been to therapists so abusive that they fucked me up even more by saying it's all my fault and I deserve to suffer until I die. In spite of this, I still go to therapy, trying to undo the damage that therapy did to me in the first place. I've been on dozens of different antidepressants and antipsychotics for over a decade. I have consistently reached out to doctors, family, friends, and anyone I trusted for help. Most of the latter have abandoned me. Most of them just make me feel worse.

I have never stopped trying, and yet I am still fucking suicidal. Every time I hear ""just get help"" or ""just see a therapist"", I want to punch someone in the face. You really think I haven't fucking tried? You really think it's that easy? You think I'm so stupid that I never even considered doing anything to help myself?

Every time someone tells me to just get help to stop being mentally ill, it makes me want to give up just a tiny bit more. All it does is prove to me that I'm a complete failure of a human being, because even getting help doesn't work.",suicide," just get help i m so fucking sick of being told to just get help every time i express difficulties coping with mental illness as if getting help is an instant, permanent solution to all of the difficulties of being alive when you don t want to be  i am now 24 i ve been in treatment consistently since i was suicidal at age 8 i ve been in psychiatric hospitals, and i ve been in outpatient programs that were full time and limited my ability to work or go to school for years in the past i ve been to good therapists, and i ve been to therapists so abusive that they fucked me up even more by saying it s all my fault and i deserve to suffer until i die in spite of this, i still go to therapy, trying to undo the damage that therapy did to me in the first place i ve been on dozens of different antidepressants and antipsychotics for over a decade i have consistently reached out to doctors, family, friends, and anyone i trusted for help most of the latter have abandoned me most of them just make me feel worse  i have never stopped trying, and yet i am still fucking suicidal every time i hear just get help or just see a therapist , i want to punch someone in the face you really think i haven t fucking tried? you really think it s that easy? you think i m so stupid that i never even considered doing anything to help myself? every time someone tells me to just get help to stop being mentally ill, it makes me want to give up just a tiny bit more all it does is prove to me that i m a complete failure of a human being, because even getting help doesn t work ",314
616,"I need to feel someone else’s skin against mineAnd soon. Otherwise I swear to God I’m gonna end my life. 

Reading posts where guys complain about the impossibility of attracting girls because of their supposed bad looks makes feel even more worthless because I know girls like me. They look at me all the time, I’ve missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like I’m trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also I’m fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and they’re getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me I’m not letting myself go. I’m fighting with all I got. I’ve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist. 

But no matter the efforts and although I’m getting positive results in some regards, the loneliness is just too fuckin’ unbearable.

Scars on my flesh, plagues on my mind. School was easier, but not all that much better. Up until the last couple years of my life, I was the target everyone used; then went back home to get more for being the pacifist I was. I've been cheated on, assaulted, kicked out, injured and discarded by the people I held in my life. And between depression and god knows what other mental issues I have, I've tried to make something of my life to no avail. Off hand, I'd say I've attempted suicide at least forty times, which is sad since on one hand, I tried; on the other, I failed.

My life has gotten a little better in the last couple years. I found a girlfriend, I've gotten employed and graduated after years of dropping out, but I know; deep down in my mind, I know I'll try to take my life again one day - and I'll keep going until I succeed. It could be a breakup, a tragedy, a massive impact in my life. I'm suicidal, and I've come to terms with it as have my friends and close ones. I don't want to be, I want to be happy, I want to be able to enjoy this life. But I can't, and no matter how hard I try, I can never cling to it. 

Its like I'm on borrowed time, and I'm my own timekeeper.

13283,"I have gone from fantasizing to planning. I want to check myself in somewhere but I am nervous.I have been having suicidal thoughts for the past few months. Last week was actually a pretty good week. But this week I have gone from fantasizing to planning. I have a lot of violent, intrusive thoughts (like shooting my face) but would prefer to die peacefully and I am thinking of where to get barbituates so I can take a bunch and never wake up. 

I do want help - I have been in counseling. I feel it is not working or not to the degree that I need. Also not sure if my meds were right (welbutrin). Thought my suicidal thoughts were from the meds but I have since taken myself off of them and still want to die. One small event will hurt me so much that my anxiety spirals out of control and I am left with nothing but chest-crushing sadness and I weep. 

I am tired of caring for everyone. Tired of never feeling sweet, fun, beautiful, smart, special, confident, capable. Hate myself. Tired of feeling like I am not enough. Tired of feeling like nothing. I am so embarassed to be having these thoughts as well. 

I want to check myself in somewhere but I am scared of the unknown. I do not want to go to the hospital. Crisis hotline told me to go to the crisis center in my city but I get the impression it has many homeless people and the care is not the best. I dont want my mom to worry. I also dont know how to tell my live-in boyfriend about it. He also has depression and anxiety. I know if I go he will take it personally and make it about him instead of offering support.

Tried to sleep early tonight to get into some sort of routine but I ended up waking up 2 hours later because of nightmares. Flicked the light on checked my phone not a single message or anything from another living soul. Decide to get up to my computer sit down check my ex's steam profile for the 10th time since we broke up. Wonder to myself if I will ever find love or if im worth loving in the first place. Check my friends list and see a barren wasteland. It was never that I didn't meet and talk with people but I have never found someone that doesn't feel like a person destined to pass through my life.
I decide to watch youtube videos to get my mind off my borderline suicidal thoughts but low and behold I have watched every youtube video in my sub box for the last 3 days. I then realized its the weekend and no more videos are really going to come out because people generally spend the weekend with friends or family.
Atleast its dark outside and for a few hours it feels the entire world has stood still and people don't expect things from me. For a few hours its pure quietness. Thing is though when it gets quiet Im left with only my thoughts. I'm 20 years old and my body feels like it can't go on anymore. I'm so alone. Supposed to be the best years of my life and I'm just watching the lives of other people while I myself am standing still and letting time and loneliness erode away at my mind and body. I don't know whats worth living for anymore.

2236,At what point is suicide acceptable? How many more days/months/years do I have to wait?28 year old female over here woo fucking hoo. Been depressed suicidal on and off since I can remember. Couple of failed attempts in my teens. It's been 8 months since my depression hit hard again. I keep setting a date then moving it. At this point if I try I'm not going to fail. Gotta buy a gun still. Been doing my research on how best to succeed. Just trying to plot the end. At what age is it finally going to be reasonable to throw in the towel? Do I really need to wait it out for years until it becomes so blaringly obvious that this life isn't worth the trouble. Seems like I've already figured that out but I keep holding on just in case. Not many more years left before spinsterdom sets in. Maybe 30? If I can make it that long. I don't know something's gotta give. I'm no spring chicken. I don't want to grow old and alone. At a certain point my life goals will be out of reach and I'll be left with nothing. At that time suicide is fair. It's just. It's reasonable. At this time I'm just waiting for my father to die so I don't have anyone to hurt. Maybe I answered my own question when he goes I will too. I just feel like if I set a reasonable date and stick to it all this pressure will be lifted. I'll have a goal. Just make it through until that date. I can do that. it's the unending road thats daunting. If there's a date I can compartmentalize. I can rest easy knowing the end is in sight.

2794,"Today was one of the greatest days of my life so far. So this year overall sucks. We can agree on that. Me personally I started having a rough year. In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldn’t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldn’t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, I’m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job I’m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so y’all know there are no family issues we just don’t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments I’ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is. 

I’m so happy right now and I’m so happy my life is taking suck a wonderful turn around!

3722,"Life is too muchIn the last 5 years my life has been hell. Went into business with family aged 21, got fucked over,  cheated and ripped off by a lot of people, nearly had my marriage split up over it. My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.

I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it. My husband moved to the other side of the world for a new job, and I'm meant to go over too so I have two weeks to try and finish it, find a renter and get ready to move to a different country and I just don't see it happening. Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.

Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time. I want to finish it but I don't want to upset whoever will find me, that is literally the only thing that stopped me tonight. Still trying to be too damn considerate of other people.

If that fails (it does seem rather gruesome and the trains are traveling slower than I had hoped) then I have an overpass directly above me that I could climb onto and use as well. I've been helped on this subreddit before, unfortunately I was unable to solve my problems in time. Before I go, I wanted to say a few things. First off, I don't really approve of suicide. Almost all problems can be addressed eventually. What I would encourage everyone to consider is their honest willingness to go through the process of recovery. This is my problem. I am too far gone, both mentally and practically, to face the prospect of living on. If you are like me, then perhaps you should go through with it. Just remember that life is an incredible opportunity. Unless you're completely sure you've wasted it, as I have, then please reconsider. Also, I want to say to those who know me, who will find this post: I apologize for this. You don't deserve to go through the suicide of a family member/friend. At the end of the day, though, I am not capable of caring enough about you to convince myself to stick around. This is due to my own flaws, rather then any of your own. Mostly, at least. Some of you are dicks and need to rethink your whole existence. You know who you are. So yeah, there we go. Make sure to not worry about stuff more than you really should. Land a guy on Mars for me, if not for yourselves. That would be pretty cool. Bye now. I'm looking forward to a long, long sleep.

What importance does it have to my life that I waste time worrying about someone else in the age when I should worry about myself? I don't mean to be rude to those who are in a relationship, but why do we feel obligated to be in one? Is there nobody who enjoys being single and all the freedoms that come with it? 

Btw I am not American, and here you are not made fun of or called a loser for being single, but the obsession with being in a relationship is the same. Then again in younger generations, as close as those born 1 year after me, it has started to get similar to America where you are a loser if you never had a girlfriend, and it's very annoying because these people are prioritizing stuff that barely matters. Haven't we seen enough memes about middle schoolers who care too much about what clothes they wear and what games they play so they seem acceptable in the crowd, and then they lose all those unnecessary restrictions in high school happily? It can be the same way with being single. It's not a crime, it can be much fun. It's not like you will never be in a relationship, everyone gets their chance.

2262,"Im trying, but things keep getting worseI got into a Masters course last year and have done quite well so far, only to realize that my college's professors simply do not know enough about the subject and are continuously placing obstacles in our path. My dissertation is also getting ruined by the tardiness of labs and my team member, who is too busy with her own research to care for mine. Yes, the most appealing solution would be to shift labs, but it is going to take me eons to do that, and my samples(which are biological) will get destroyed all the same. So even though i have put in more effort than most of my classmates, i am staring on the brink of failure and i badly want to give up.   
I don't have anything to live for except the fact that it will make my family unhappy. I have a few online friends i care for, but beyond that, i have no social life worth talking about. I decided to avoid relationships after my gf's death from cancer last year, which is again a source of continuous mental turmoil. And the therapists in my country are assholes, besides, i simply cannot spare any time for therapy.   
Why should i not die? Is there any point in continuing to embarrass myself further? People keep telling me about how these failures are making me stronger, but they're not. Im 26 and i should've completed my education long ago. This isn't a fantasy world where a person has unlimited resources and time.

As far as my memories go I know there'll be some of a game I played at the time. 
But I think the first time I ever realised something was off with me, was in 6th grade, when I finally got off of a 3 month grounding for a poor grade. Only to hop back on the computer and feel different. Like the grounding sucked the life from video games. I still played though, just different games. They never seemed the same though. Now I still play them regularly, just with different priorities. 
Now I've opened up to my girlfriend recently about some dysfunctional family issues that I hadn't realized were problems until now. 
One being a memory of how my dad would say ""Now hes becoming smart"" after I learned to keep quiet when asked about things I did, good or bad.
Or how I'd have to cry nonstop at my door while grounded in elementary school for my dad to allow me outside the house with friends. 
My mom always told me its how he was raised in his family and that its to show he cares, so I went with it and let it go. 
But now I'm beginning to understand why I would stay in my room all day, on the computer hiding.
I played through my worst and best times. after or before suicide attempts, and achievements. 
I don't feel emotionally involved or connected to anything anymore. My chest doesn't even hurt anymore when i cry to my girlfriend over text, instead I just feel hollow. Even dread is losing the bite it once had.

Some stay alive because of music, art, movies and what not, I can't feel much joy indulging in them anymore. By the end there's always this lingering emptiness and they just feel so repetitive, like they are slowly grinding away against my head.

Some live because of their friends, I lost all that and I have no one to share anything with anymore. I don't feel that I have anyone to call family, they are all strangers to me. Don't feel like anyone really cares about me anymore, no one to turn to, hence why I'm on here in the first place.

I'm recently married to a wonderful lady. I have fantastic parents. No debt. Good health. I am in good standing in my program, and I have a job offer for when I graduate. So why am I getting these thoughts? Is it the 80-hour workweek with no sign of reprieve? Am I imaging all the other students hating me? Why don't my advisers ever seem satisfied with my work? Why do they treat me and my time like it is worthless? I always feel rushed and, consequently, incapable and irresponsible. Is this real or just an unreasonable environment? Is this all be compounded by being many, many thousands miles away from home?

No one knows it, but I am struggling. They all think I am making leaps and bounds in my work. I am. But I am falling fast. The only reason I haven't off'd myself is because of what how my family would take it. It would not be not fair to them. I owe them more than that, but if they were to disappear, so would I.

I tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be OK once I graduate, but could I be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape it?

7536,"Is spirituality necessary for happiness?I like science, and like to use it to explain some weirder ideas I have.  Like the basics of karma, ""What goes areound comes around,"" you know the word.  Energy, gases and liquids move along a pressure gradient; higher concentrations of these move to lower concentrations.  The same kind of idea as to why we have weather and how we are able to breath.  I use to think that when you do something good, that good karma goes to the person you helped and you are now on the lower end on the concentration gradient.

But now that seems so stupid.  We all have this wrinkly, fatty lump in a bone box full of electricity and chemicals.  Most of those chemicals we have are now defined and categorized, and some synthesized into pills.  But even when we know which chemicals make us happy, they don't work enough.

Linear thinking gets us to dark and dangerous places, and I know that's where I'm headed with this stupid train of thought.  But I've been grasping for answers for a  L O N G  f#ck!ng time.  You can only google so much.  I want answers but being paranoid is being dissatisfied with all of them, and the answers I don't get make me think people are hiding things from me.

Sending out this message into a sea of strangers with similar problems that they all heard of is redundant and (again) stupid for me to do, but I feel like convincing myself that there is/are god(s) is the only other option besides drinking until my mother finds me dead, which despite living on the floor above her would take a day or two.

8263,"I'm scared if he dies I'm gonna kill myselfSo the main idea of this post is that I'm struggling to predict what my state of mind will be if my dad dies so I have no idea how to prevent killing myself on impulse. If anyone's got any advice or resources or anything that might help prepare me I'd appreciate it.

For context I'm 18, live with my dad and the rest of my family is in different countries and I'm not super close with them. No friends except my best friend who I only know online. Always been super close with my dad and rely on him for mostly everything.

So on Tuesday my dad's getting a surgery n if shit goes wrong I'm worried it's like gonna put me over the edge

He has cancer n this shit has happened before but I've always been suicidal so losing him could really put me over the edge so like I'm tryna prepare myself

Basically he had a surgery before that went fine but they said the cancer had spread

N I almost killed myself that night
Only didn't cuz he was still alive n I hadda live for him

That was 3 years ago

But yeah u can see why I'm worried if something goes wrong with this surgery n he actually dies
I won't have the same reason to stay alive

I got other reasons but I'm like worried what I might do just on impulse.

11628,"I have borderline personality disorder and my Favorite Person just abandoned me so now I wanna dieBPD stands for borderline personality disorder. In a nutshell, it's having unstable moods, emotions, self\-image, and behavior. There's an irrational fear of abandonment and frantic efforts to avoid it, unstable relationships, self\-harm, extreme emotional swings, suicidal ideation, chronic emptiness, explosive anger, and dissociation.

A lot of people with BPD have what you call a Favorite Person. A Favorite Person is the one we seek validation from the most, fear abandonment from the most, and want to spend time with the most. 

Anyway, my FP is a guy I met through Reddit so he lives oceans away. He stopped talking to me a few days ago and blocked me everywhere because I am such a piece of shit. I've tried everything to stop him from abandoning me but he did it anyway. So now I wanna die but not really. I mean, I just want to end the pain but I have so much to live for.

But IDK, I just want to end the pain. It hurts so much. I've been trying to cope by flirting with a lot of people \(mostly boys who only want one thing, which reminds me of that meme\) and drinking heavily and dissociating and hurting myself, but I still feel like shit and I want to die.

I needed some time to think about if I was ready to just back in to a relationship and took 4 days to think. During that time the girl got into another relationship.

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend.

I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me.

Topic: Microcephaly (one of the rarest disease)

**If you have interesting topic please leave a comment.**

Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected. During pregnancy, a baby’s head grows because the baby’s brain grows. Microcephaly can occur because a baby’s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth, which results in a smaller head size. Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.

Severe microcephaly is a more serious, extreme form of this condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Severe microcephaly can result because a baby’s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy, or the brain started to develop correctly and then was damaged at some point during pregnancy.

Babies with microcephaly can have a range of other problems, depending on how severe their microcephaly is. Microcephaly has been linked with the following problems:

Seizures
Developmental delay, such as problems with speech or other developmental milestones (like sitting, standing, and walking)
Intellectual disability (decreased ability to learn and function in daily life)
Problems with movement and balance
Feeding problems, such as difficulty swallowing
Hearing loss
Vision problems

These problems can range from mild to severe and are often lifelong. Because the baby’s brain is small and underdeveloped, babies with severe microcephaly can have more of these problems, or have more difficulty with them, than babies with milder microcephaly. Severe microcephaly also can be life-threatening. Because it is difficult to predict at birth what problems a baby will have from microcephaly, babies with microcephaly often need close follow-up through regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor their growth and development",non-suicide,"reviewing something everyday until i find something interesting day^12 12th day topic microcephaly one of the rarest disease   if you have interesting topic please leave a comment   microcephaly is a condition where a babys head is much smaller than expected during pregnancy, a babys head grows because the babys brain grows microcephaly can occur because a babys brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth, which results in a smaller head size microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects  severe microcephaly is a more serious, extreme form of this condition where a babys head is much smaller than expected severe microcephaly can result because a babys brain has not developed properly during pregnancy, or the brain started to develop correctly and then was damaged at some point during pregnancy  babies with microcephaly can have a range of other problems, depending on how severe their microcephaly is microcephaly has been linked with the following problems  seizures developmental delay, such as problems with speech or other developmental milestones like sitting, standing, and walking intellectual disability decreased ability to learn and function in daily life problems with movement and balance feeding problems, such as difficulty swallowing hearing loss vision problems these problems can range from mild to severe and are often lifelong because the babys brain is small and underdeveloped, babies with severe microcephaly can have more of these problems, or have more difficulty with them, than babies with milder microcephaly severe microcephaly also can be life threatening because it is difficult to predict at birth what problems a baby will have from microcephaly, babies with microcephaly often need close follow up through regular check ups with a healthcare provider to monitor their growth and development",309

I'm 27 year old female. My story is this:

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away). I went to hospital for a while and when I got back to home, I continued all my bad habits.

Now I'm in university, but I just can't do THIS anymore. I should've graduated half an year ago, but I'm lazy and stupid. Also my fiancee (formerly mentioned as the old guy) hates me nowadays. I'm disgusting, stupid water buffalo in his opinion (yeah, I've gained weight and I don't look like a 16 years old anymore). It's sad 'cause I know it's true. I hate myself and I'm sad for all my relatives 'cause they need to pretend to care for me.

I'm 18, the youngest employee at the nursing home where I work. I was hired after coronavirus began sweeping across the U.S., and let me tell you about some of my experiences with COVID.

We don't allow visitors. Healthcare workers and employees are the ONLY people allowed inside the building. This means the residents haven't had physical contact with their loved ones (children, grandchildren, SPOUSES) since March of 2020.

I *know* these residents personally. I know about their husbands and wives, their past careers, their hometowns, and how they like their coffee. I've seen the most lively people withered down to skin and bones, on their deathbed surrounded by healthcare workers because they can't see their fucking families. 

I've arrived at work to find empty rooms from residents suddenly being whisked away to hospitals because of covid, never returning, and one day walking past the empty room to find the nameplate has been removed. they're not coming back. 

With the lockdown, you might ask, how are these people getting covid? because the employees lie about having symptoms, relatives drop off gifts after being exposed, and people just aren't being fucking safe. 

We have to wear masks / face shields for our entire shift. This isn't difficult, if I can do it in a hot, humid kitchen for 11 hours straight, you can do it in the grocery store for 20 minutes.

I am 100% sure that no one at college cares about me either, plus I have never had a real friend since elementary school. The loneliness has been crushing. I can't even get a job either, I tried hundreds of applications and job fairs but none of the employers ever got back to me. I tried to kill myself 2 years ago through overdose. But it didn't work. But the overdose did cause a ""dystonic reaction"" that consisted of severe muscle contractions that went throughout my whole body (especially down my spine). It was the absolute worst pain i have ever encountered in my life. Eventually at the hospital, they gave me an injection that reduced the process.

 

I feel like that I am going to do something crazy again because my life hasn't improved. And I don't know how to have interesting conversations with people so I don't even bother with introducing myself. No one at college ever talks to me, I don't know why but it seems like I am just not worthy of people's attention. And I have spent 3 years in college though i have only completed 6 classes; which has made me feel stupid, slow, and worthless. It feels like college will never end and i will never get out of this hopeless situation.

9017,"Physician heal thyself...First off, I work in healthcare and it’s reached the peak for me at the start of the new year. All the naive has been beat from me. Nothing is going to get better about this system. I came in with ideals and self preservation in mind.
I can help people and save lives, maybe even spark change, and I will have a solid skill set so that I am able to leverage my job as needed. 

I’m the squeaky wheel. The squeaky wheel gets beaten into shape or drowned in oil until it stays quiet for ages knowing the price of making noise. 

It got to me little by little. And my counselor reminds me that this job doesn’t define me and I need to be more than just my career when I think of my whole identity. That’s the absurd thing - our careers have bred us to be the job, to give our all to the job, because not everyone can do the job - just we few. And fewer hold on long term. 

And that’s partially why. We keep reverting back to our weak human forms despite the bumps, injections and reindoctrinations of our God like ability and ego and hubris.  

I am a failure. I can only fight against this by truly letting go and it hurts so bad. And the cure is not living day after day denying and downplaying. I just want to end things because I can’t take another psychological war fare because I stand up to the powers that be and cry foul. I do it to protect my life and patients alike.

3126,"Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier, but here's some background if you haven't. Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid. Turns out that while it does have what I wanted there's a little more on top; **flash porn**. Most of these are ""games"", games in quotations because really, they're just animations that I can control the speed of. One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn. If you're not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material. I would have to guess about 65% of the porn is actually yiff. Like I said, not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that, and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews. The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on, no tags or thumbnails included. This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess, but it's also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork. However, most of what isn't furry shit is low quality, which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000's. With all that said, I did end up finding something to nut to, and yes it was yiff, not afraid to admit that.

Overall, I would give using Flashpoint a 6/10 as a source of fap material.

I'm in the depths of a depressive episode and was inches away from committing suicide last night. I had my pills ready, I'd written my will, I'd come to peace with it. I was almost miraculously saved by a friend who was concerned by a conversation we'd had that evening and saw me, spoke to me, listened to me, in the middle of the night despite her having to go work the next morning. She's given so much of her time and help and I am incredibly thankful and lucky to have her. She's offered to speak to my parents about this (I don't currently feel like I can), she's looked up safe place I could stay in my city, charity counselling services, offered to call them up for me.

But because my brain is a piece of s*** I don't want help from any of the services she's mentioned. I don't want my parents to know, I don't want to speak to mental health volunteers, I don't want to stay in a safe place for suicidal people. I don't fucking know why. Maybe I don't believe they'll help, maybe I don't want to accept that they'd help. But I do want help. I'd give anything to feel differently. To feel hope.

9758,"Going through a lot right now, I'd rather just be deadI live with a pretty heavy amount of stress normally. I work two jobs, six days a week, and I'm in college part-time. Last year my four best friends ghosted on me when I was really depressed and self-harming. I almost killed myself in December. Since then I've managed to push my online best friend away. Right now my grandma is dying, and one of my clients at one of my jobs is dying. I was already struggling with that but today one of my old friends messaged me to give me a head's up that she's moving into the same apartment building where I lived, and just renewed my lease. I already have pretty bad social anxiety and trouble leaving my apartment, I'm terrified of running into her on campus already, but now I don't even feel safe in my own home. I mean, physically safe, sure, but not emotionally safe.

It seems like I should just finish what I started planning for in December and kill myself. Coincidentally I live a short walk away from a popular suicide bridge. I've got one long-time friend, but she's not great for talking through this stuff. But, I feel like I should wait for my grandma and client to die before I kill myself. And I'm wondering for my mom's sake, is it better to kill myself really close to when my grandma dies so she can mourn her mother and daughter at the same time? Otherwise, how long is long enough to wait to kill myself after my grandma dies? There's some other stuff making me feel like shit, but these are the big things.

Police officer from the land down under here.

&amp;#x200B;

New account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of back story to this post;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a Police officer for the past five years and I've pretty much seen it all. From petty theft to suicide. Today I attended  a suicide job that has hit particularly hard.

&amp;#x200B;

See the problem was, we didn't know what we were walking into. We came across a car that was parked just far enough out of the way to peak our interest. As we approached the car a familiar smell filled the air, it's a smell you don't ever forget.

&amp;#x200B;

As we investigated the scene we found more and more of this persons final few moments. The pile of cigarettes in the centre console, the crushed cans of beer in foot well. 

&amp;#x200B;

This person had laid out photos of his kids on the passenger seat of the car. They then wrote the words 'Please forgive me' on the back of their hand.

&amp;#x200B;

The mess was unforgettable and has played over and over in my head since I left work.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm sharing this is to plead with you, please, for what ever reason your thinking of taking your own life; please don't.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't have to be there when we come to comfort  your wife, husband, son's and daughters.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't be there to tell your children that mummy or daddy won't be home for Christmas.

13193,"I made a terrible fucking mistake! Yesterday afternoon, my dad bought me some jalapeños and habaneros to make some salsa with. I instantly got to work, never thinking to put any gloves on. When I was done, I put the salsa in the refrigerator, washed my hands and ate dinner. 


The second dinner was over, my parents and I got the salsa out and ate it with chips while watching a movie. It was really good. The floral taste of the habaneros really complimented the onions and vegetal flavor of the jalapeños. The three of us watched three movies before it got dark and my dad left (my parents are separated, but still great friends). 


Not taking any chances, I washed my hands after I was done eating the salsa. About an hour later, my mom took a nap. I thought, ""Hey, I got a house to myself pretty much. Now's a good time to jerk it."" I went to the bathroom, pulled up a sweet vid on PornHub with Malena Morgan and Mia Malkova and went to town. Despite handling the peppers hours before this and washing my hands twice, I still felt an INTENSE burn halfway through. 


I cried on the toilet for a few minutes before crawling to the couch in the living room and getting into a fetal position, clutching my junk which reduced the burn for some reason. After a few minutes, my mom woke up and asked me what was wrong, so I had to confess. She told me where the aloe was and started laughing once she knew I was better. 

The moral of the story is to never masturbate on the same day you've handled hot peppers.

Obviously making me a bad person. All i do is sit here, overthink and cry everyday. Im not allowed outside and my days consist of staring at walls for hours.

9821,"Every day is relearning how to live.I’m not sure how much longer I can do it. Wake up. Get out of bed. Shower. Work... just remind myself of the routine while I hope things improve. People say things get better but I’m having trouble believing it. Depressed for as long as I can remember and finally diagnosed and medicated 7 years ago. I try to keep up on hobbies and have something to look forward to but that gets harder every day.

The last 20 years have been a complete waste and it feels impossible to come back from that. There’s the ex gf that broke up with me on he day that I was going to propose. Had the ring in my pocket, even. Thought it was perfect but found out later she’d been cheating. Went from her to a girl I married in spite of red flags. I thought I couldn’t do any better and just dealt with her emotional abuse. I’m now divorced and being forced to sell my house and move in with parents in my late 30’s. Just a complete failure. I’m looking at being stuck living with them for years while I pay down the debt I’m in thanks to ex wife. 

Then there are the friends. I already don’t have many and try to fake happy but they still fade away or cut contact. Even that gf mentioned above. I tried to hate her but couldn’t and we were friendly a couple years later but recently, she called. I thought just to catch up but no, she was just beating around the bush before saying goodbye for good. 

Nothing gets better. The few things that are good that I hold hope for just crumble. I should have listened when my ex wife told me to kill myself.

I'm writing this here because my friends and family are alarmed enough and well, I dont really want help. I just want to talk. To tell someone what I'm feeling.

I've tried to kill myself twice this year already, both time just being disappointed it didn't work. I dont see no way out, my moods wont stop and considering possible BPD and all the fucked up things that happen in my brain and the things I do I dont see it changing. I'm hurting the people around me and I can see it. Me dying won't be easy and I know it's a void that will never be filled in many hearts of that I know. But at this point, I find it hard to care. I'm at my happiest when I've thought that I'm finally dying. And with this, I won't be able to hurt those who I love anymore.

11407,"Tired of going through this cycleI’ve suffered from mental illness since 2005, my first year of college. I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist in 2012 and have run the gamut of different diagnoses and medication.

Currently, I’m told, I’m bipolar. I haven’t had hallucinations in a few years so my diagnosis changed from schizoaffective to bipolar. Anyway.

I’ve been dealing with this cycle of going from being able to function to being completely unable to concentrate, get out of bed, etc as well as having weeks feeling like a superhero.

I...just can’t do it anymore. I emailed my therapist and we’re going to meet in the morning. Every time I start to feel okay, something seems to click on or off in my brain and honestly I don’t realize it is happening until it’s too late or whatever it is has progressed to a certain point.

I’m sitting on the toilet at work. I’m hiding. I have an enormous amount of work to do at a job I’ve been at for 2 months. In 2 of the last 3 jobs I’ve managed to hold down, I’ve had to take a short term disability absence. I’m at the point where I feel like that’s necessary again, but can’t get paid leave until I’ve been here greater than 12mos.

Like I said, I don’t know that I can continue this cycle of up and down and functional and dysfunctional. I feel like I’m harming my family more than I’m doing good.

Not sure what to do at this point. I wouldn’t call myself actively suicidal, but I wouldn’t complain if I just up and disappeared somehow.

This post is to sort of...Give them a break. They've been through a lot already with me, and I'm feeling so guilty about opening up about myself every day. I feel selfish, irritating, repetitive...I keep saying the same things, how I hate my body and face, how I don't believe I've got any talents, how my personality isn't desirable...
They keep reminding me occasionally how they feel about me, but I regretfully feel like it's all lies. How could you love this?

I keep making it worse. I thought this was just another ""phase"" of mine, but it's not going away. I keep telling them ""Yeah, I should be better after a couple of days!"" But now every day is a struggle with me. Waking up is really hard. I have a constant need to put myself down. I've managed to hide a part of it, but on some days I just need to be painfully obvious about it all.

I don't know how long until they're both gone. They'll find better, they've already found it...probably, I'm just assuming as usual. This constant need of validation feels really awful. I feel toxic.

13811,"Constant thought about torturing animals... and I enjoy them.Some backstory:

I have a history of mental illness (depression, bipolar disorder, short-term schizophrenia, psychosis), so I'm almost positive that nothing I feel or think is ""normal"". With that said, I'm concerned that the thoughts and situations I keep imagining will come true, with or without my consent. For a short while I was psychotic (the delusional kind), and lost touch with reality. I never got help because I've only been able to talk to one therapist and she's no longer an option.

I've also harmed animals in the past -- a few of the chickens we own/owned have broken wings, legs or other bones. I accidentally-on-purpose stepped on a gerbil. These were a long time ago and I thought I was over these impulses. Obviously I'm not, because I keep thinking about various ways to injure or kill my cat. I just now caught myself mentally debating whether or not I should snap his neck first.

1270,"My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course, I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag. When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasn’t ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn’t work and she decides to kill herself “she’s tried her best”. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I’m doing is trying to help. Her reactions aren’t that of a normal person so it’s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don’t make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I can’t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can’t be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her?

4807,"I've felt this way since a childHello all, I'm 23m
And as far as I can remember I've never wanted to be here.
My childhood was full of domestic violence and drug abuse.
And I've never felt truly loved or cared for
But I'm a coward
When I was 9 I would go to the kitchen everynight and hold a blade to my wrist
Crying because I couldn't cut myself.
Crying because I want to die
Over the years as growing to an adult I have experienced nothing but turmoil and shame 
I try to be a good person and am never foul to another soul
And recently I aquired something real in my life 
And I love her so much
But things quickly changed 
She's stuck on her abusive ex

The thing is I've never felt this way about anyone 
I've always had to force myself to love people 
But with her it's different
I didn't have to force anything 
I got to be me with her
Told her more about myself than I've ever told anyone 

But I don't have her anymore 

And I think I'm ready to get this life over with 

It's not just the heartbreak 
I've numbed that
This goes deeper 
And this is the only thing that feels right.
I don't know when I'll finally reach the ultimate peace 
But I plan to runaway soon 
Probably hop trains and live as a junkie for abit. 
They always said I'm just like my father so I'm going to be that before I die.

I really don't know why I've written this out 
And I don't really think I can change this

I had an awful childhood. My parents had 7 kids in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house. We didn’t eat breakfast. We never brushed our teeth and rarely bathed. My dad would beat us, and my mom would say things like “beat them” I remember my sister pooping in the tub and my dad peeing in the sink when the toilet was in use. I never drank or did drugs but my dad found zigzags in the couch and my mom found beer bottles in the yard waste and they always just came at me. It was never me.

I tried to kill myself when I was 22. I still have ups and downs, sure. But since then I’m married, my husband and I are homeowners, we have more money in the bank than outstanding debt. We are pregnant with our 3rd kiddo and we always have food in the fridge. Though I have my degree, I am able to stay home with our kids for now and I know we just have it way better than most.

But I’m 32 and not a day has gone by for 10 years that I haven’t thought about killing myself.  They say it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem but I’m over here like...it’s a permanent solution to ALL my problems ever.

And then people like Robin Williams and Chester Bennington and Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain... I’m worried I’ll be 62 and it will still just plague my mind.

6136,"I need someone to help me deconstruct a disturbing trend in my thoughts.My history is I went through several years of depression, about 8 months of it quite crippling. I got out of it, I developed coping mechanisms, improved myself and feel I have been well and truly cured of it for 7 years or so.

Recently, however, my lifes outlook has taken a nosedive. I am extremely apathetic, lack motivation, find solice in semi self destructive activities (well, that's how I feel about it, just watch tv-shows and play games all day when there are productive things to do) and the solutions are right there, but it's just so.... ""depressing"" the place my mind is in.

I sometimes feel like my coping mechanisms are from the ""taking it a day at a time"" approach. But now that I'm well, that's been very counter productive. Just accepting the situation and getting through it worked well when I felt the only option was suicide, but now that all the opportunities to live life to full is there, I'm still jsut taking a day as it comes.

What concerns me the most, is I feel vulnerable. I let this happen too much longer, life will inevitably deal me a rough hand when I won't be able to deal with it. I will fall back into bona fide depression. 

I am dealing with intrusive thoughts these past few months. They are taking the form of suicide as an option. It's not dangerous, as i immediately recognize thes thoughts for what they are.

6511,"I picked a day13 January 2021.

It was going to be December because it would be closing out a year of when my life started to fall apart, but I know that I can't choose something so close to Christmas. It would ruin the holidays for my family. There's nothing significant in January, so it's fitting that something as insignificant as my death would take place then, too.

Ever since I was born, I always felt like something was wrong with me. I just didn't fit. Other people noticed and avoided me. They still do. It wasn't until last December that things started falling apart. A small  piece of me was always stained, but now it feels like I'm decaying from the inside out. I can feel it in my chest. Behind my eyes. In the back of my throat.

I'm tired. Always so tired. I can't claw at the edges of this pit anymore. My nails are broken. My hands hurt. Every time I look up and try to call for help, another shovelful of dirt hits me in the face. Everyone outside of the pit can't bury me fast enough. My family. My coworkers. People I liked  to pretend were my friends. Doctors. Therapists. They're all shoveling as fast as they can in the hopes that my wailing will stop. That my mouth and lungs will fill with dirt and they'll never have to hear me again. Eventually the pit will be full, and they'll never have to see me again. I'll just be a memory, like a nightmare they can't quite remember fully. And they'll be relieved. Happy.

I realize I will have to go against my moral code of ethics, and have to lie, cheat, and steal. However I am more than willing to do this and beyound if it would mean I could kill myself in piece. 

I have wanted nothing more in life than to die for 22 years (give or take a month) i am in therapy, see a psychologist, and still have a handful of people that cafe for me.

My second goal is now to make people who would give me the world, and make them never want to hear my name again. 

Being in the mental health system for over 2 decades the only skill I have acquired is to convince peope that I am not going to do it. When in reality I am just not doing it now.

I did meet someone this year that I thought hey maybe she might like me. She was a kind single mother of two. I helped her out when I could. Things like her car broke down so I drove two hours to fix it. When it died i bought a PT cruiser that was in rough shape from a buddy, I spent 2 months fixing it up for her.... Well anyway none of that matters. Now she is with someone else. I am yet again forgotten.

We started getting along, having fun on lessons and lunch breaks. We were best friends.

Fast forward again now to 4th grade. All the classes were mixed and we sadly weren't in the same one. We still hung out and stuff but didn't have as much time for each other as before. Year 2016, February 14th, Valentines day. ""It's my chance!"" so since we didn't finish lessons at the same time I gave my close friend a letter from me to give to her after school. He gave it to her. Same day, just after class, she messages me and tells me she had a big crush on me since 1st grade ""The fuck!?"" was exactly what I wanted to say. So we started dating (as much as two 10 year olds can date).

5th grade. I was moving to another house so we broke up. Damn, I really liked her (and I still do).

Fast forward to 9th grade (present day). Guess what. I'm in the same school as Sara. Our school is now in a 3 month lockdown so we have online lessons.

I've been single for 8 years and that's with putting myself out there doing my best.  From going to the gym, library,  taking various courses like cooking or Spanish, going to the bar. Playing sports like soccer. I think my problem is im short,  skinny, not very smart or funny, and don't really look like a man for a 26 year old.  I've had one interested for several weeks,  I liked her a lot and I can tell she liked me to,  before telling her I had herpes and that was the end of that. I had just finished school and was ready to escape and leave everything behind me,  need to get out for a while, but my dad called telling me he has cancer. So I've been living with him trying to do the right thing. I've got no friends left. I don't want to be here but I can't leave. I can't tell my dad because he's dying and that would be selfish of me. So im just laying here ready to leave this world but I have to get up at least until my dad is dead.

7747,"The reasons that make people depressed and suicidal IMO1. While you are alone, you let negative thoughts take over your mind. You did this a few days in a row and it became a habbit.


2. You don't do what you love in life. Try to do what you love and don't force yourself into doing things you hate. If you really hate ur job then quit. You hate anything? Get rid of it if you can. Or at least stay away from it.


3. You think you need something but you really don't. You are frustrated because you think you deserve something, maybe you do but thats the luck of the draw. All you really need is food, water and shelter to survive.

4.Because of society. It tells you what your life should be like. Its just a recommandation, don't take it too seriously. It makes you think you are worthless if you dont obey its rules. But its just not true.

5. If none of the above...you may have a real, temporary problem. Something that can't be solved/avoided no matter what...Like a convict being imprisoned in jail. Like a kid not being loved by the parents. In this case, I'm sorry. I hope you can carry on. But even those problems will be solved in the end... time will solve them.  The prisoner will get out of jail eventually...the kid will grow and will be independent of his parents eventually. There is still enough reason to carry on.

Because she's a girl.

That reasoning might make you upset. That's fair, honestly. I've just found that on a subconcious level, girls will only tolerate negative emotion from other girls. There's probably other factors at work, of course, and I desperately want to be wrong, but... Gathering more evidence isn't worth the risk.

13355,"I'm addicted to the zen from accepting deathI'm 22 this year. 

At the start of the year, I went to a therapist secretly to figure out why I have suicidal thoughts despite not having crippling problems. 

In short, I've never learnt to sit with discomfort. It stresses me out, makes me want to run away, want to kill myself. Doesn't matter how big or trivial it is, I want the unpleasantness to end. 

At 20 and 21 years old, there was one day in each year I was dedicated to kill myself. The former I had planned for half a year, to die on my 20th birthday, the latter, maybe a week of resolve. 

Each time, I felt zen. I felt no sadness nor happiness, but somehow I felt content. The emptiness actually made me think I could continue living a little while, because without the discomfort I'm actually in an alright position. 

But now I'm suffering again. Without going into details, it's always regarding my family. I made a deal with myself that if my parents ever hint at regretting my birth again (the first was when I was 11, the second when I was 19), I'll just end their misery by ending my life.

I keep having a recurring dream in which I'm locked in a dark room with only a noose and a chair. I spend a fair amount of my - unlimited - free time researching methods of suicide and am currently deciding between CO and Opiate overdose.

The worst part is that i'm painfully aware of how good I have it compared to other people, with parents that would let me just lie about for months whilst barely complaining.

I live in Brazil, so we're still at peak pandemic. I've been isolating for the last year and a half, and during that time, developed a lot of eye floaters, suddenly. Now, I can't concentrate in the classroom, or look at white screens, documents, papers, and so on - they slosh around, blur my vision, and just annoy me in general.

It's confusing - they could just be using Google Classroom, Forms and Meet, and everything would be properly integrated.

4302,"Something's broken in my headI'm going to end it all tonight

I don't know what was wrong with me as a child but I would stress myself out about absolutely everything, to the point where I couldn't breathe, and I still do to this day. It eventually drove me to the point where I accepted death as a possible way out in situations, of which I would think about daily... It was at that moment that I felt something broke, because since I was around 13 (I'm currently 18) this urge to just end it all, to avoid all future stress, has grown to the point where I'm becoming dangerously close.
It's evolved past the point of being linked to depression, or stress, or anxiety. This urge to end everything is becoming completely independent from my emotional state, and I feel it constantly now. 
I've already tried to hang myself a few times, then cry myself to sleep when it didn't work. I used to do it as a way to scare myself back into shape, but the more I do it, the more I realize that in all honesty I just don't want to be alive anymore, and each time I do it I get a little closer to completely losing consciousness and becoming brain dead in that tight, embracing rope.

I guess this is a cry for help. I used to talk to friends about this, but I told everyone that I'm fine now, deep down I know it'd be easier to kill myself if they weren't worried about me...

14377,"2019 was the best year of my life. 2020 might be the last
In 2019 I left an abusive relationship for good. In 2019 I left my toxic home environment for good. I went abroad and found myself – outside of abuse and harm. I spent the year learning and growing. I made new friends and had new experiences. I got my first tattoo. After I left such a toxic environment, the skills I had been learning for the past 7 years finally began to work. I could finally comfort myself, appreciate myself and feed myself without hating my body. I finally developed relationships with real boundaries and genuine care. 

In March of 2020, I moved back to the house I never thought I would be in again. I began to hate myself. My own thoughts drowned by the mindless shaming that I experienced. My family filled my room with their unwanted items. I began to feel swallowed with the feeling of being forgotten. Surrounded by unwanted items, I began to feel unwanted. I woke up in pain and I fell asleep in pain. I cried until my head hurt so badly that I couldn’t move. I watched my dad welcome my sexual assaulter into my home.

15291,"I Never Exist Until I Threaten To Take My LifeHonestly I don’t see the point of talking to people

Throughout this whole quarantine not one person.. ONE.. asked me how I was doing during this quarantine

I have to be the one to start the conversations

I have to be the one to keep relationships alive

I have to remind people I exist

Why do people suddenly change when I say I’m killing myself?

I know why

They want to feel like they did their part in helping me so they feel like they didn’t contribute to someone’s death

Because if anyone found out they didn’t their reputation is tarnished

Nice if them to finally care about me

I guess all it takes is a suicide threat

That’s stupid

This is why I’m done with giving people chances. Everyone is the fucking same

It’s already bad enough you don’t ever notice me

Then you say I’m demanding too much time or I’m overreacting or I’m making it an obligation to talk to me

Those are the dumbest things I’ve ever heard

If I send you a message and you leave me on read that means you ignored me

If I send you a message and it was from 2 hours ago but your last signs of activity were 15 minutes ago that means you ignored my message and you’re too insecure to let me know by leaving me on read

IT’S THAT FUCKING SIMPLE

So stop saying stupid shit to justify your actions

Just stop it

I hate how society just accepts this like it’s normal

This is why I want to kill myself

I attempted suicide by cutting my wrists but a friend dropped in and well saved me. (Sounds too good to be true I know but used to live in a place where I had an open door policy for friends. Call it good timing or something else).

Anyway, with the help of antidepressants and support I moved, got a new job, and started feeling... Good. Until recently.

I rent a house with my partner and dogs (these guys got me through my previous depression) however now the landlord is rasing the cost per month as well as now asking for a deposit to be put down. Or else we will have to leave.

I have no savings, I barely make ends meet, everything seems to be going wrong and breaking. And it's all at once. I can feel myself falling back into my depression. I've been suffering with headaches from stress of being kicked out and my career suffering from this, I've been taking painkillers (codeine) and keep upping the dose each time to numb myself.

4794,"No reason not to.I've been thinking seriously about Suicide for over a decade now. 

All I ever wanted was to have a family and settle down, but it didn't happen. I try to do other things, but they don't make me happy because it's not what I wanted. I'm halfway through a PhD because learning was just something to fill the time. I hate it. There's no point doing anything else because it won't make life worth it. 

Found out in January that I can't have kids. That means I can NEVER have the life I wanted. I'm alone, sick and deep in debt from the PhD so adopting ISN'T the option people keep telling me it is - like it's SO easy and SO obvious. 

All anyone says is THERE'S PLENTY OF TIIIIIIME!!!!! YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIIIIIFFE! And I'm sick of it. Time has run out for me. I'm only going to get more sick. I've ended treatment because I don't want to prolong my life - I doubt it will kill me, but I don't want to drag it out. 

Suicide is ideal for me. No more pain. No more sickness. No more debt. No family to leave behind. No partner. No friends. Last time I was in hospital I was gone 4 days and nobody noticed. I've tried reaching out but nobody listens. They have partners and families and don't give a shit about those of us that weren't good enough. 

All I'm doing is using up time until I die - why prolong it? It just seems so much less wasteful to go now and be out of everyone's way.

15152,"I feel content nowI've been struggling with depression for 6-8 years now. I finally came to my own conclusion that there's just no point in continuing on. I talked with a therapist, but it ultimately did nothing for me. I thought about seeing another one for awhile. I decided against it because I know everything they'll tell me already. ""You have to do this, do that."" However, I can't find a single reason.

There comes a point where you feel nothing is salvageable and I feel I've reached that. Everyday is essentially the same. Any time I see family, friends, whoever - it's always the same conversations. It may as well be Groundhog Day. I've had enough of it. Every time I reached out to someone, whether it be a friend or family member, it went nowhere. They all know about what I want to do. So if I'm honest, I couldn't care less what they'd think if I was dead. I'm not important to anyone. I know people may say/think, ""that can't be"", but it is true. I can say it with absolute confidence. There's not a single person to keep me here.

So I feel going to the woods to finish my business later on is the best thing possible. I'm 21, but I just don't care. I see people working so hard just to live and that's incredibly unappealing. I don't want to feel like a slave. I take comfort in that. I'm sparing myself years of whatever pain that could lie ahead. It's also kind of comforting to tell someone about it.

Ok I'm 29. I used to study medicine but that didn't work out.  Then I got a job in the city which I loved and a few months later everything changed. I was 25.

Basically I started hearing a voice (never did drugs or anything) and I had this voice control me ever since. I know it sounds like a bad movie but this voice can control everything I do and say. 

It made me lose my job. It stopped me going to the gym and being healthy. It makes me smoke every day. It doesn't let me get another job or talk to a girl or exercise.

My life is watching tv / twitter/ reddit all night until 8am in the morning. Then waking up at 3pm and going out to get a coffee alone. Then watching t.v. again until 8am the next day.

Medication has been tried and doesn't help. I saw a psychologist but I guess it was too much for her because she said she wasn't experienced enough lol.

So imagine right now you can no longer work , be in love, you have to smoke which you don't want to, and you can't exercise. Your life is tv. 

It's like a prison. Would you want to live like that ?   It's not enough for me. I have a loving family and a couple of friends but it's just not enough.  I want a job and my own place and love but I will never have it because this voice won't let me.

But I have really bad trust issues and it affects the way I see her sometimes. It really hurts because I do truly love her. Ever since the first few weeks we met.

When she tells me nice things I find it hard to believe that she actually means it and that she doesn’t actually want to be with me and recently I’ve been suspecting she has been seeing my best friend behind my back, without any evidence. She’s not the type to do such a thing but those thoughts can’t leave my brain.

 He asked her out sometime in August but she declined but later I began to see that she took an interest in him but then stopped after a while. I was always the side friend I’d say. In September and October we began seeing each other more in uni and soon I found out she liked me all along and it just started from there.

We have regularly been discussing it and she know about all of my suspicions and worries and she always tells me that I’m being stupid and paranoid and that I should see a therapist because she wants to be with me as much as I do, she says.

936,"Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

9602,"Making my 7th suicide attempt tomorrow morningMid 20s male

I'm not unattractive, but not a male model or anything. I take care of my hygiene and wear nice clothes. I keep my space clean and organized. These things are all so hard but I make sure every day things are taken care of.

People tend to like me but I isolate myself. Many people care about me but I never do anything social because I feel out of place doing anything with anyone. 

I have a very loving family who will do anything to help. It hurts me to know how much stress I've caused my family and others, and how much pain my death will cause to my family and so many others.

I have increasingly severe depression and anxiety I've lived with since probably birth or very early childhood. They've led to other mental health problems. I've learned very well how to hide them so I appear to the casual onlooker to be doing ok.

I've made 6 genuine suicide attempts in the past few months. I've tried so many therapists and so many psychiatric medications. Still working with a therapist and using several medications.

I'm so young and if I keep fighting I know I can pull through this and create a decent life for myself and do a lot of good in this world.

But I'll likely continue trying to kill myself until it works despite all the professionals and everyone else who have tried to help.

I'll probably fail my attempt tomorrow and end up in another mental hospital. I've been spending lots of time in those lately.

I feel so guilty.

Both of my parents died before I turned 21 from alcohol addiction. The rest of my family I don’t feel close at all with anymore even though I’m now less than 6 hours away from them all (used to live across the country). I go to college but I’m older and feel so out of place. Nothing here feels genuine and I often feel like I have to hide my intense anxiety and discomfort here. I often ask myself why the fuck I should even bother anymore. I feel like dropping out and just giving up on trying to be normal and finding some labor job that’s enough for me to live.

Been getting just creeping thoughts of killing myself even though I’d be too afraid to act. I’ve been talking to a counselor but I honestly don’t know if I need to go further than that. Mental illness runs in my family but I don’t want to be put on pills or reveal my suicidal thoughts. I’ve just been claiming anxiety which I’ve struggled with since I was 15, but it feels much more intense since I’ve started college. I get crying fits because I don’t feel like I’ve dealt with the shitty things in my life, and then I feel guilty since people have much more fucked up lives than me.

5741,"I Wish My Suicide Was SucessfulI don’t know if I’m alone on this feeling.

Last fall I overdosed on a pretty hefty amount of pills. I took 20 gabapentin pills and about 400 extra strength acetaminophen like a dumbass (since that sort of overdose is apparently a horrible way to go) and ended up in the hospital within 3 hours bc I was violently vomiting :).

I was in ICU for 3 days and known on the third floor as some “miracle child” because apparently other people have overdosed on less and ended up dead.

I don’t feel like my recovery was a miracle. The more I think about it I’m jealous of people who were able to actually go through with their suicide from start to finish. 

Over the course of the past few months I’ve still wanted to kill myself nearly everyday and now it feels like I’m out of options. I can barely swallow a single pill—the meds I’m now on for my bipolar—without gagging. I’m too much of a bitch to jump off a bridge (although I used to say that about overdosing and I was able to do that). I don’t have access to a gun. I don’t have a car for carbon monoxide poisoning. Slicing my arms seems too painful to me. I fucking failed at the only thing that would have ended my pain.

And now I can’t stop regretting the fact that I lived. I think about it and regret going to the hospital in the first place. I regret not trying to leave the hospital bed when they were saving me.

I went to this restaurant in my city for my aunt and uncle's wedding anniversary. The food wasn't bad. I had to go to the bathroom, and this is February, so pre-virus restrictions. There were three dudes waiting in line, so I waited behind them. The bathroom setup went like this: There was a women's bathroom and an all-gender bathroom. I thought it was weird that there was no men's bathroom. As I waited for the three dudes to finish up, I think six or seven women passed me and used the bathroom in the women's room. I got a peek inside the women's bathroom (I didn't go in) but from the view I got, it looked like a nice and modern bathroom with two stalls, a flower pot (with fake flowers) and mints. Then the guy in front of me stepped out and I stepped into the all-gender bathroom. It was... crap. The tile had cracks and was crappy. There was one toilet and a sink, and the bathroom in general was dirty. The broom and dustpan were still in there too. The toilet had some scratches and so did the mirror. The entire time as I sat there taking a dump, I was thinking, ""what the fuck?""

I talked with my friends, and that cheered me up a little. And then I talked on a depression hotline, to someone who helped convince me that it can't get any worse.

Boy was I wrong.

My dad forced me awake at 6:15 this morning. He immediately, right off the bat, started yelling at me. He somehow knew that I talked with someone. I don't  know how, but he did. He assumed that it was one of my friends, and started yelling at me. He also threatened to hit me and to throw me out of the house. All for trying to deal with all my stress and not go insane.

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head.

1254,"FUCKHey y'all

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same ""it'll get better!"" ""you are more than this"" ""it's just a feeling"" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

Happy new year. If you see any hope at all, you better cling to that and don't let go until you've got enough hope and happiness to last you lifetimes.

4254,"I'm sick of life. Nothing seems good any more even when I'm on medication.I could write a whole story about my two dimensional shitty life but I think I'd prefer to just sum it up in the least amount of words possible.

There is no career that seems interesting to me, dead end jobs seem even worse and my family don't seem to understand. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet it because I haven't thought of a cool way to do it. I'm being serious, if my life is so bleak and uninteresting I might as well make my death quite fucking spectacular. I also don't want to ruin anybody else's life in the process. For example, I jump off a building and hit a concrete floor, I wouldn't want some poor bastard to find my mangled body. I shoot myself in the head, what about the person who finds that mess? No. Not like that.

I'm at rock bottom, the lowest I have ever been in all my life. I almost wish I was religious, maybe I could turn to a god for help at this time. I also wanted to add that I haven't killed myself because of my dad. I am his only son. My mother had a child to a different man so she would still have another son. I'm not saying that my dad would feel worse, both parents would be completely destroyed if I killed myself but you guys know what I mean? I don't think he'd have many reasons to live if I did it, whereas my mother would be stronger for my brother's sake.

5539,"I wish I could die in my sleep, but also make ""practice"" attempts (passive vs active suicidal?)I'm usually passively suicidal and wish that: (1) I could sleep forever and never wake up, (2) I was never born, or (3) I could die peacefully in my sleep. Sometimes I feel like a burden on my family - like they deserve better than me - but I know rationally that taking the final step would crush them, so I won't do it. On paper I have a good life and lots of opportunities, and other people out there have much worse, so I have no right to commit suicide anyway. 

I've been fantasizing about a comforting, peaceful death for a while, and recently started learning about different methods. I used to take the pill bottles out and just stare at the pills before putting them away. Today on an impulse I tied a sheet around my neck and tied it to the doorknob, but untied it right away, before it even started to get tight. So basically ""practicing"" how I would do it, even though I genuinely do not plan to attempt or put my family through the consequences of an attempt.

(yeah, I'm so useless I can't even find the guts to make a proper attempt).

Is this still passive suicidiality? Has anyone else experienced passive ideation but still ""rehearse"" for an attempt you never plan on seeing through?

I've never been able to afford therapy even though at times (like now) I feel like I desperately need it.

Alright. So what's that mean?

3 500 mg hydrocodone can send someone into shock resulting in death. But I'm so use to popping them i usually just take 5 to get a trip going.
Do the math.

I'm not sure why you're over reacting to someone you dating for 10 days? 

LOL
That doesn't really have anything to do with it.
I've told you multiple times I fucking hate life. It's unbareble. 
unbearable 

So your telling me that your really just took that many and are trying to kill yourself?

What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasn’t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didn’t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didn’t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I don’t believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 

6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

I'm getting a divorce. After 5 years, it's become clear that I just don't have the emotional capacity to be who my husband needs. We agreed to a divorce a couple of weeks ago. Last night, he got drunk and really aggressive sexually, even though we've agreed not to have sex anymore. He groped me in bed, wouldn't stop, I tried to pull away, he kept pulling my legs apart trying to touch me. I eventually got away and asked if he could just maybe hold me. He said no. After all this time, I'm nothing to him. Absolutely nothing but something to fuck.

I took a blade out of some old razor and tested it out on the side of my hand. I can feel the wound everytime I flex my hand. It's a little uncomfortable I should've tested somewhere else.

Then I cut three small lines on my bicep, stupidly below the t-shirt line. I don't know why but watching it bleed felt really really good. It bled a lot. It didn't really hurt that much and I cleaned the cuts with antiseptic. That stung a bit. I washed the blade (with antiseptic again) and put it in a tissue in an old wallet and hid it on my wardrobe for next time.

Recently I've been going in and out of severe mania. I found a guy online who was willing to meet in a dark field, in the middle of the night, and made out with him just to feel something. I've been drinking nonstop and taken an excess of medication to see if it would kill me by accident. 

I want to fuck up my life, so I have nothing left and kill myself thereafter. 

I can't deal with living my life anymore. No matter how happy I seem, I feel like I'm rotting inside. It all just seems so pointless.

Well I've tried to so many times before but they where all failures because i wasn't 100% committed. the reason why i want to do it is because first of all i have always been suicidal ever since i was 6-10 i remember being in my room trying to hang myself at the age of 10 or younger because i thought that i was worthless and useless (back then i didn't even know that suicidal was a thing and what i was doing and thinking was apart of it). Now it has come back but worse than before because every single week i am bound to have a break down or get into a fight with my parents or siblings. Now i am done with the world and i just want to do it i just want to let go and forget about everything and everyone because they all remind me of something that just fucks (sorry for my language) me over and makes everything worse!!! BRUHH I AM DONE!! NOTHING can fucking keep me happy or stop me from ending it anymore now i just want to do it and i know that nobody would care in my family but my friends  i think..............................I hope will!???....

1972,"I did everything I was told to do. For years. It doesn't workAnyone who looks at my post history can probably tell this is a venting account, and as people can see,I have been like this for a very long time. Ever since I stopped being a Christian back in the mid 2010s

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets ""UHM ACKTUALLY"" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

I cut myself off from a lot of people for him and it’s my fault I don’t have anybody to turn to now. I’ve got no family here or friends. We live together and I have to hide how I feel or it’s all anger and not perfect and “you’re not who you were six months ago.” 

I felt like I’ve come so far though, I had such a bad self harming problem among other things and I’ve not gone back there, mostly due to the guilt he will give me but surely that’s still good

I’m genuinely considering ending it. I just want to talk. I’ve tried all the helplines , anybody I can think of really. I live right by the subway and think about it all the time. I know it’s selfish to do it that way but I can’t help it

I tried it (on accident) and it was freaking me out. So what I did was I was laying on my bed looking at my phone. My head was on my pillow and my left eye was completed covered by the pillow, so I was only looking with my right eye. I was like this for 30 minutes to an hour. Then I decided to fall asleep, so I got up to plug in my phone across the room and turn off the light. 

When I got up, my left eye (the one that was covered) hurt. I closed my left eye and had normal vision. But I opened my left eye and closed my right, everything was way too bright and blurry. I just kept my left eye shut until I turned off the light. 

Everything was totally dark and I couldn’t see anything. But when I opened my left eye, my vison got crazy. I closed my right eye. I could see in the dark!! When I only had my right eye open, I couldn’t see anything at all. I was freaking out and was worried I had gone blind in that eye! It took over 15 minutes for my right eye to adjust to the dark.

5837,"I feel lostI thought about posting something like this for quite some time now.

I have been thinking about killing myself for years. Most of the time those were more like idle thoughts,  unlikely I would act on them. But there are phases where I am close to the edge, especially the last few months and right now. I don't think anyone of my family or friends has the slightest idea about this. 

The main thing keeping me from actually killing myself is my family. I really like them and feel terrible at the thought of my parents, brothers and sisters having to mourn such a loss. Especially because I guess I'd be rather likely for them to blame themselves. 

So if I don't want to put this pain on my family, what's keeping me from seeking help?  I guess it's selfishness in a way. Anyone I'd talk to about this would be obliged to talk me out of it I guess. And I am currently not sure I'd want that. I want someone who will just listen. And at the same time I don't want to talk anyone about it. Because I don't think it's too unlikely I'd still go through with it. And of course I fear how horrible anyone I'd have talked to would feel then. 

Not sure what I'm aiming at with this post. Just kinda needed to write this out I guess. Any comments to help me clear up my thoughts would be appreciated.

9613,"Suicidal thoughts but too cowardly to go through with it...This is just me ranting, 

I lived a very introverted fucked high school life, by which I mean that I carried a lot of child abuse onto my university life. 

Now I decided that I'll try to get my shit together and not let my past define me.

And so my new chapter as an international 
Student in the UK starts. With the drive of wanting to build a career, I'm more determined than ever to work my problems away.


3 years later, I finished my bachelor's degree and developed severe substance abuse and intense procrastination induced depression.

Now that I'm at the end of my Masters programme, I no longer can muster up the will to continue working because I have wasted most of time not working on my dissertation and spiralling out of control because I will be wasting my parents money.

Alas I've been given an extension to submit my dissertation,I had given up on working but now that a chance presented itself I fell into my old habits.

Initially I believed that I could overcome my unwillingness to work once a chance presented itself. 

But now I'm convinced that my weak personality got the better of me and that if I willingly chose to fuck my future at an important cornerstone of my life, then I'm allowing myself to be a loser that doesn't need to be a burden to my closed ones.

How did I escape years of abuse find love and happiness with family and friends and yet If a car came barreling my way I wouldn't move?

I'll always have depression, bipolar, anxiety, PTSD, fucking *schizophrenia* because of what happened that was out of my control. I'm gonna be miserable all my life even when I'm happy as can be and I'm supposed to be *grateful?*

Most people who went through what you went through would come out in a lot darker place, if not dead. Youve done everything *right*"" Everyone says this to me who finds out my story, despite my loving personality. WHAT???????

Right now, I do not trust myself. This is the first time in about 7 years that I have seriously considered committing suicide. My life isn't even bad compared to anyone else's but there is a weight in my head I can't get rid of and I'm being dragged down. 

It would destroy my little sister, my Mam, my Dad and my girlfriend, who is going through a very hard time right now. I know it would destroy them, that's what always held me back. But I don't know if even that could stop me right now. I could do it tonight, I really could.

I probably don't even deserve to be posting here, I feel like an imposter or like there's other people way way worse who deserve the help, not me. But apparently I am not very strong, not strong enough to stop myself from feeling this way, or too weak to deal with it anyway.

I don't know what to do, I don't know who to talk to. Maybe I just need someone to say that I'm ok, I'm not a parasite. Maybe I don't need anything at all. I don't want to ruin my little sisters life, I don't want to be a tragedy that everyone talks about sadly. But I really don't know how much longer I can ignore how I'm feeling.

2192,"Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didn’t know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I don’t know how valid it is, but I’m just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that I’m going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  I’m incredibly anxious that I’m in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.

Despite being raised in a comfortable environment with nary a want in sight I find myself far beyond the edge. I've lived with an aching sense of emptiness and lack of emotion for over 15 years now, despite only being 22 as of this April. I hate myself for even beginning to feel like this for what I have and for the fact that there are so many people in this world who are far worse off than I am.

My mother is sympathetic and tries to help and all I do is shun her away with what little bit of emotion I have left, anger. I have been through many sessions of therapy and many antidepressants and yet I feel I have no place in this world. The only thing that is keeping me alive is the debt I yet owe to my parents from my college loans, which are still piling up as I somehow trudge forward. Despite being on my way to becoming a pharmacist, I have no hope for the future and would rather just end it all here.

I have been close to suicide before but at this moment I have a knife in front of me. I feel like ending it all at this moment despite my debts. Despite the horror I know I would inflict on my family, everything just feels right. I am such a worthless creature that I can't even take into consideration how others would feel.

12812,"no one understands me.all my life i’ve been the odd one out.

i wasn’t exactly ostracised growing up, but because understanding and similarity in the outlook of life is so important to me in friendships, any friends i made would always drift apart and i’m not gonna deny the fact that i played a big part in that with the detachment and unnecessary arguments/feeling irritated with my friends.

it’s like affection repels me but being ignored/mistreated attracts me.

i always feel like i have to tone myself down when i’m around/talking to people. my mind races with thoughts and ideas i’d love to say out loud but the fear of being shut down &amp; looked at as weird always keeps me from saying anything. the thing is, whenever i present an idea or an opinion it’s bashed but as soon as somebody else brings it up, they’re praised and agreed with, so i just prefer to keep to myself.

i also find it hard to initiate getting acquainted with people and letting them get close to me. other people usually have to start conversations with me first. 
i wish i wasn’t so offstandish and bad at replying.

Ive thought about how my suicide would affect my family and i know they'd be horrified and it would scar them, but eventually they'd learn to cope and move on and not too long after they'd all die too and none of it would even matter anymore.

It is a white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is odorless with a saline taste. It contains 38.28% potassium by mass. In the monohydrate form it is highly hygroscopic and deliquescent. As a food additive, potassium citrate is used to regulate acidity and is known as E number E332. Medicinally, it may be used to control kidney stones derived from either uric acid or cystine.  Potassium citrate is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth and is excreted in the urine.\[2\] Since it is an alkaline salt it is effective in reducing the pain and frequency of urination when these are caused by highly acidic urine. It is used for this purpose in dogs and cats, but is chiefly employed as a non-irritating diuretic.

It is widely used to treat urinary calculi (kidney stones) and is often used by patients with cystinuria.\[medical citation needed\] A study of 500 patients with recurrent stones found that it reduced the frequency of stones from 2 per year to a half per year.

But today I was home alone, doing the washing up and I noticed my SO had taken a small knife out of the lock box last night to prepare dinner but had forgotten to put it back. I didn't want to hurt myself but I found myself pressing the knife against my wrist and sawing it. Luckily the knife wasn't as sharp as I imagined so it wouldn't break the skin. It made me feel sick for a bit and I pulled myself away, dropped it and went into the other room. I rang my SO but she didn't pick up. I left a message. For some reason after I hung up I stood back up and went back to the sink, picked up the knife and started sawing again, though I didn't want to. I tried several times to slice open my wrist, i put as much pressure into it as i could and eventually, by angling the blade I managed to draw a small amount of blood. It made me feel good. Powerful, though that feeling of sickness was still there. At that point my SO phoned me.

1928,"Not really suicidal, just depressed...For a while (a couple of years) I have been getting more and more depressed. However, I'm very good at hiding it, so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is. 

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks ""Are you O.K?"", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say ""Of course Mom!"", and move on with my life.

4011,"If you're bored and are looking for a light read, check out this book I wrote when I was younger! Hi everyone! When I was younger (think preteen age), one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life. Recently, I've been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason. It's definitely not worthy of publishing, but I am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist (10-12). Some things I wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after I wrote it, which makes me curious how it would be received by others.

Here is a synopsis of my book: *Ten-year-old Margaret Lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways. She's learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult, which naturally involves many changes. The story opens as Meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named Wayne. Join Meg's ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships. You'll meet nice and mean girls during the journey, but beware - most girls around this age can be both! And, of course, as the title would suggest, Meg develops a crush on a boy named Max who is actually fourteen years old. How will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence Meg and the world around her?* [Read Max and I to find out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9QXF08iQtf31iGRPq29mFz51ccMdfbJWib7sXf0Tko/edit?usp=sharing)*.*",non-suicide,"if you re bored and are looking for a light read, check out this book i wrote when i was younger hi everyone when i was younger think preteen age , one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life recently, i ve been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason it s definitely not worthy of publishing, but i am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist 10 12  some things i wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after i wrote it, which makes me curious how it would be received by others  here is a synopsis of my book  ten year old margaret lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways she s learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult, which naturally involves many changes the story opens as meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named wayne join meg s ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships you ll meet nice and mean girls during the journey, but beware  most girls around this age can be both and, of course, as the title would suggest, meg develops a crush on a boy named max who is actually fourteen years old how will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence meg and the world around her?  read max and i to find out https //docs google com/document/d/1m9qxf08iqtf31igrpq29mfz51ccmdfbjwib7sxf0tko/edit?usp sharing  ",280
5434,"My classmate killed himself a few days ago. Today the police found his suicide note. It was addressed to me.I didn't know him much. I honestly just knew him as the guy who swore way too much with his friends in class.  


I barely talk to him maybe once a week? And even then its him coming up to me and then leaving in the middle.  


I understand suicidal thoughts, I have them too, but why??

His suicide note said that he loved me. That I was the single best thing in his life and that he was already saving up some money to take me out on a date (they found about $1200 cash). But it also said that his loneliness was too painful and that he's ""unlovable"".  


I dont understand... He never showed that kind of interest in me when we talked... I dont know. Maybe I'm gonna go up there to him.  


Why didnt he tell me? He always seemed like a cool guy, I wouldn't mind going out with him. I... I want answers. I was emotionally detached from it but now he's involved me. He loved me. I know what that meant to him, the entire school saw his scars. His note was 2 long pages of everything he found beautiful about me.  


I'm fucking crying. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.  


C, I'm coming soon. I just need to figure out how. And then you can take me out when we're up there and I'll let you kiss me, no problem. But please do tell me what made you do this. Please.

Lets just say shit hit the fan because my moms boyfriend complained to my parents and sister in a group text chat about me not liking him. (He does stuff like this occasionally) He said I'm bullying him. I was home alone and my parents were angry at me, texting about how bad I am. They had no clue what it was like having your parents split up then having a guy move in who constantly is using self pity to get everyone to turn on you. 

I was so fucking angry that no one out there got how I was feeling and I was about to snap and finally kill myself. My sister came home to hang out while I was having this breakdown and I realized though she doesn't live with us she has been out in the world a lot and knew kids just don't like parents boyfriends who move in. We talked through my bedroom door and she got me to come out of my room and I told her I'm depressed.

Holy shit. It felt so good to finally tell someone. We talked about everything that happened and about our mom. My sister said it gets better once you move out. I think I might actually remember that moment for the rest of my life.

For the past two months I've been attempting to get a refill on my prescription (that has not gone well).

Well, they took that as me being flippant about my situation and took me for a walk around campus. 

They showed me the memorial for that day and said ""this is what happens when we don't take mental health seriously"". They were comparing me to Cho. Saying that I could kill someone. Honestly, the first thing I thought was ""Well I'd kill myself before I'd kill anyone else"" but I obviously didn't say that so I didn't get taken away. They made me feel like shit for not trying hard enough, even though I felt like I was trying everything I could and nothing was working out. 

I wasn't a victim, I was a suspect in that moment. I don't know how to feel anymore. I don't even want to go outside because I'm afraid everyone looks at me like a bad person now.

In fact, I absolutely hate to lose a game. Throughout these few years, I've been playing MOBA games like League Of Legends and SMITE. And at first I did ok, but it went downhill from there.

First on LoL, I reached the minimum requirement in order to play ranked games. After the placement games, I got placed in Bronze 1. I tried to reach my big goal of gold in ranked, but too many obstacles got in the way and I've dropped to Bronze 4. I tried everything and I'm nowhere near my goal.

And on SMITE, the storyline is pretty much the same, but there's 3 game modes, and I got placed in Bronze 5 in all of them. That's the lowest position possible. I tried to climb my way up, but I got stuck.

Everyone's performing better than me, I always end up with more deaths than kills, and I keep having more losing streaks than winning streaks. After all this, I feel worthless, I feel hopeless, I feel weak, and I feel like a big wimp. I just wish something would go right for me for once. Just this once.

**When?** The day before my 30th birthday.

**Where?** In my rented flat, alone, sitting up in bed.

**How?** Can't discuss method but it's painless, peaceful, and a drug-free method preferred by right-to-die advocates. It'll be a breeze. I've had the equipment since July and I've tested everything works.

**So what?**

* I want my family to read my journals over the last year, but I don't want the police to take it. So, I will post them to my own address on the day. They will arrive the following day; at some point my family will check my mailbox.
* I have already written a generic decoy note to leave behind. I've written it in the pages of my passport.
* I've printed my full credit report which might help family deal with practical financial matters following my death.
* I've already registered with the 999 text service which is meant for deaf folk. This means I can schedule an SMS for 1 hour in the future to allow my body to be discovered almost immediately, so my organs will be good to donate.

932,"I want to talk about suicide without it being a jokeRecently my MDD has kicked in again. Around Easter is always a shit time of year. I'm graduating college soon and I actually have my life mostly planned out, just not implemented yet. I still can't help but feel hopeless and like there's no point. I'm the kind of person that jokes about killing myself or wanting to die. Partially because I mean it and partially because I don't want to be some downer to people around me. My friends who know I've struggled with depression get a little worried about me, but not enough to do much, though I don't know what the hell they could do. 

The last time I openly admitted to wanting to kill myself, my psychiatrist (not counselor) had me admitted to a mental hospital, twice. My closest friend, who I also have a crush on (gay) is the person I want to talk to about this stuff the most, but I feel like he's tired of me. He's the RA of my residence hall and if I'm honest with him about suicide, without just joking, he'd mandated to report it and it's back to the hospital with me. Which I can't do right now because I need to finish my degree and it doesn't help that much anyway.

3269,"Suicide, and it's cowardice. Or is it?Much like the rest of the world, I live with the thoughts of suicide, day in and out. I hear on a regular basis (local folk, not on the internet), that suicide is a coward's method, that it is 'taking the easy way out' instead of solving the problem.

Still, I'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that I can't seem to be rid of.

I've driven all my friends away, save the select few I've known for years. I've distanced myself from family, and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I can't let go of until I'm forgiven by whom I'd hurt. 

Suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. While it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

We're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. And, I think that counts for something. It's not cowardice that drives is to that point. It's one final breath of courage.

Fact: A single NASA spacesuit costs millions of dollars to make! In fact, NASA currently only has 4 EVA-ready spacesuits available (In case you didn't know, EVA stands for ""extra-vehicular activity"", basically it's when an astronaut does a spacewalk). The last EVA-ready spacesuit was built in 1974, and it cost somewhere between 15 million and 22 million dollars. That's right around 150 million dollars in today's money! For a single spacesuit!! This is because spacesuits are incredibly complex, and are essentially their own spacecraft, but made for humans. These aren't your ordinary work clothes! They have to:

Protect the astronaut against the vacuum of space, and from intense solar radiation.

Protect against tiny particles moving at up to 18,000 miles per hour.

Provide oxygen, communications, telemetry, and everything else a human needs to survive.

Allow the wearer to still perform tasks and have decent maneuverability during spacewalks.

These things are COMPLEX. And it's actually starting to become a problem. NASA is running out of good spacesuits! Fortunately, they have dedicated $250,000,000 to the development of the new xEMU suit, which is to be used for the Artemis missions to the Moon, beginning in 2024.

So, in my fit of despair and panic, I got to thinking, and I came to the conclusion that if I'm not already dead by the time climate change starts getting really bad, I'm going to kill myself. Current projects say we have been 30 and 50 years of relatively normal weather and stuff until things start getting bad (I.E. superstorms, droughts, famines, floods, sea level rise, overpopulation, mass displacement and immigration the likes of which we have never seen) I can't see myself wanting to live in a world like that, and I certainly wouldn't want my children to live in a world which I knew was going to be worse for them than the world I was born into. So my view on global warming is that its only a matter of time before disasters begin to strike, and we enter into a new era of hopelessness. I'm 19 now, so I got a few safe decades to live.

I have a 7 year old son. He is the only reason I haven't blown my brains out. Recently started having anxiety attacks. A first for me though depression has always been a struggle. Finding that anxiety seems to be enough to push me over the edge. The idea of going to a nearby gun store to purchase a gun (to use on myself, would never harm anyone else) actually feels calming whereas in the past it would usually bring me to tears.

I know intellectually that suicide is a bad idea but can't seem to shake the feeling that my death would be a release. I moved across the country last year after my father died. Wish I could join him. If child support payments weren't so high I would honestly change careers as computing no longer seems to be the passion it once was. I don't have very expensive tastes so why should I continue to kill myself at a job that bleeds into every other corner of life?

Anyway, my son is better off with his mother. I hate to leave him like this but I don't see any other way.

* That one wholesome person who I met on the train when I first went to visit my ex.
* Someone who had to look over me at a hospital who gave me a memorable piece of life advice.
* A very friendly person I met on a train station, with whom I talked about something important to both of us and hugged goodbye.

.. I look up to:

* Abigail Thorn (Philosophy Tube)
* Niall Comas (Pyrocynical)

* The friend I meet up with irregularly, who I can be open with, without being judged and who is on the same wavelength in many ways.
* My brother, who shares a similar absurdist humor, helped me become more critical of what certain people said and with whom I have the most interesting talks with.

So a little backstory, I had depression for about a few months where I physically was not able to get up and moving and has suicidal issues . I never did get proper treatment as I never really came out about this because my parents are very religious and they’ll just say “go pray some more” and nobody really cared and thought I was just an arrogant, spoiled, brat and this adds up to the fact I’m agonistic and didn’t tell anyone but my uncle who doesn’t care about how religious I am. So recently, my parents were trying their hardest to figure out why I was such I guess a weirdo. So they were basically telling me to stop being so moody and start being more mature. And me not having any of it started yelling and I stormed off crying in my room. Later, my older sister said that I was acting like such an asshole to my parents and that I was overreacting(She already knew about my depression and my thoughts) and to stop making others uncomfortable. I told her she can go Fuck off and to leave me alone as I still have reoccurring memories of me wanting to die and I’m very sensitive about it and all she’s doing is making it more stressful.

Everything, but them. but sometimes it's not enough. i first tried to kill myself when i was 16 (i'm now 21) and diagnosed with a non curable chronic pain disease. what was the point? we all live with pain but i'm drowning in a sea of pain without any life jacket. i've done the treatments, the meds, the numerous therapies offered- but the only reason i can't follow through to end this pain because of them. i saw the hurt in my parents eyes after waking up in that hospital, that hurt i caused them for just a split second trumps all pain i've ever felt. It hurts me even more that they gave me such an easy perfect life and all i want to do is end it. They would sacrifice their own lives for me to live a pain free one. no matter how much i don't want to get out of bed or no matter how much i just don't want to live this life anymore, i WILL live yours as your daughter till the day you die. 

To my Mother and Father, i'm so sorry for feeling so hopeless when all you do is try to find endless ways to give me hope. You've done everything for me- the least i can do is save you from that suffering.

I really really tried to tell myself i didn't like her. But being honest i guess i liked her.

I imagined being with her. Not in a creepy way. I just tend to imagine situations. How it'd be going out with my friends and having a good time, hugging everyone i respect and ""love"", i imagine myself doing stuff I'd never be able to do, or saying stuff I'd never be able to say.

We kind of were friends (not bug friends, just... ""friends""). *Were* because thanks to quarantine I lost any chance of getting to know some beautiful people i met not long ago, her included. Those friendly relationships abruptly stopped because of covid. 

I've recorded an audio-testament (is that an ok term?) and she was one of the ppl outside of my family i spent most time giving a personal message wishing her the best. 

It's stupid. I know. I just... Never stood a chance. I've never had a girlfriend (I'm 20yo) so I've got no experience. I've liked a girl just twice. Just two times I've feel I'm in love with someone.

I'm really having an extremely hard time dealing with my anxiety/depression/intrusive thoughts. 

Roughly a month or two ago, I started getting really depressed and anxious. I constantly thought(think) that my S/O is or has cheated on me. It's like little movies that play in my head that show what my mind thinks she's doing. It seems extremely real and graphic. It also happens when I'm asleep, I dream the same vivid/graphic thoughts. 

She gives me NO reason to question her. She leaves her phone open, offers to let me look through it, is constantly telling me she loves me. We are together every minute that we aren't at work. We're getting a place together and so forth. Both of us are extremely mature and have fantastic careers. When I say she gives me no reason, she gives me no reason. She knows all about these issues and sticks by me and supports me. 

I have a counselor and I'm on some meds that aren't working. 

I have had past traumatic relationships: ex killed herself, others cheated on me constantly, ex-wife was physically,mentally and emotionally abusive.

12204,"I don't feel like living because my girlfriend left me.We've been dating for 3 years and it came to an end . I deserve it to be honest. 

 5 months into our relationship I didn't get ''sexy time'' over cam so I started talking to a female friend and started flirting. I went on cam and tried to masturbate on cam, she ended the call and I didn't tell my girlfriend anything. I thought that if she didn't know she wouldn't be hurt.

 School ended and she slept over at one of her friends houses. She was then told via text by a bunch of her friend that they didn't want to be her friend anymore. It devastated her. To add to that she found out about me and what I did. She lost a lot of trust in me but after begging for forgiveness she gave me another chance. 

I fucked up a lot in the 2 years after but the one that crossed the line was when I dumped her. She was begging me not to. I wasn't thinking. I decided to try and message the other person again. My (ex) girlfriend said she wanted me back. But the day after I told her what I did she said that was it. I managed to get another chance. But two weeks later she said it hurt to much.  

Now I just feel like standing in front of traffic.

This is my first girlfriend. But I love her more then anything. Maybe I'm just over reacting.

14798,"Life is bleakI just tested whether I can hang myself. The tie I brought seems unsuited for it. I will have to use rope.

I don't really feel depressed right now. I have dealt a lot with depression for the past 8 years and it doesn't really feel that way. At least not with the heavy heart and feeling of despair that I have come to associate with depression. Not with the complete inability to act either.  
I am just apathetic really. I used to have goals and things I wanted to do and I still try to set goals, but they don't motivate me to do things. I don't really want to do things anymore.  
Every winter I get depressed and this year was rough, but it seems to be over now. The worst thing about being depressed is not being able to do things. That is incredibly boring. However even when not depressed, I have increasingly run into the problem of not wanting to do anything, and it makes my life boring and uninteresting. I still do things, and they can even be interesting for a while, but they don't make my life fulfilling.  
I don't consider my life bad. I have my studies, am in good health and have family and friends. I also have access to professional and financial help. In theory my life should even be pretty good, but in reality, it just doesn't seem interesting enough to be worth living, and there is no sign of that changing.

So long story short I have two best friends (one male one female) and they obviously like eachother but that dosent matter rn.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I'll finish hs and most of if not all of my college before they get out and that is IF they get out because... you know... it's the military.

So anyway, if my spelling is bad I cant see due to tears in my eyes so yeah.

Due to his criminal history it’s hard for him to find jobs in the fields that he is interested in so he mostly stays home. A lot of his anger is related to the things people say to him. He’s been called lazy, stupid, piece of shit, and every other insult you can think of and mostly coming from his girlfriend of 7 years’ parents. They laugh at him and mock him because she makes more money than him. At this point he keeps talking to me and telling me that he feels like he has no purpose and that he feels like life is not for him. In trying to help him and talk to him I find myself feeling very sad and scared that he is going to do something that he will regret. Yesterday he went on an alcohol binge and was putting a gun to his own head not to mention this is a frequent event that occurs. I don’t know how to help him.

14324,"Ex-gf making a really convincing argument for leaving this world, what do I do?I recently met with my ex-girlfriend who I know to be depressed, largely in order to try to get back together with her.  In our process of catching up, she told me she'd been on a suicide watch recently and that she was becoming more convinced that life is pointless.  She's always told me that she doesn't really ever feel happy, she just can get distracted by things like seeing me be happy.  I think she mostly persevered due to a Christian sense of servitude (we're both Presbyterian) and a love of nature.  However, she has increasingly become more sure that people suck and only harm one another and nature.  Any arguments I've made in opposition to that line of thinking have sounded stupid as soon as they left my mouth.

Last week sounded definitely worse, though.  I asked her about how her faith factored into all this and she told me how she feels like its eating away at her.  She thinks it's a sin whenever you don't help someone you could possibly be helping, and honestly, she's right.  So she works and works and works to serve everyone she can, and then still feels guilty for not doing more, which is how I should be feeling, though I just push it out of my mind.

15707,"I'm tired of being ""okay"".Four years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and have been going through therapy and taking medication. During that time, I also self-harmed, attempted suicide, developed psychosis, OCD and eating disorder. 

Now, I'm in a much better place - I eat normally, live normally, haven't hurt myself in about two years, etc. Sometimes I fall into an existential crisis but that's about it. I'm really proud of how much I've made it through. 

However, lately, I've been feeling suicidal again. I wouldn't say that I'm depressed but I'm absolutely tired - of everything. I stopped listening to music, reading books, talking to friends on a daily basis. I also start to procrastinate a whole lot and I feel 'nothing' most of the time. Lately, my parents have been experiencing financial hardship and they've been verbally abusive. My friends also compare me with themselves whenever they get a higher grades or getting a new clutch or whatever. I think about killing myself a lot and I couldn't care less about what others would think. 

Everyone thinks I'm ok but I'm not. I'm so tired of being ""okay"". I'm far different from being ok. I don't see the point anymore - after all, everyone will die someday, and since I'm doing nothing good for the world, I might as well end it here, right? That way I'm not a burden to my family.

Every year I fantasize about doing something to honor his memory and help other people that are considering suicide... and I never do. I have always felt like if I could somehow share the pain in my heart with the world NOBODY would ever end their life prematurely again. Every year I feel the guilt of not being able to save my father, and every year I feel the guilt of not being able to save you.

So Here we are. I've drank my whiskey like I do at the beginning of every July 4th, and this time I've made up my mind. I'm going to try and tell you:

If there is anybody you care about in your life- ANYONE in the world that you care about... please don't do it. You can't fathom the ways the taking of your life will change the world. My life has never been the same... nothing is as good as it should have been. I miss my father so much and I would give anything to have him back. 15 years...


I wish I could explain it. I hope somebody out there reads this and decides to give their life at least one more day. If not for yourself do it for the people you would leave behind. You don't know how important you really are.

I've been married for almost two years now, to a guy who never understood how I feel. And today, he hit me. Slapped me. Punched me. Pushed me. And covered my nose and face to muffle my screams, so hard, that I thought I'd die from loss of breath. Then, he booked me tickets to my parent's, and asked me to leave the very next morning. 

I don't want to stay with him. Of course not. But going back to my parents is not an option. I have no money, no friends, nothing. Everyone thinks I am in this happy marriage because I have lead them to believe so. And there is not one person I am comfortable in confiding. I had taken to cutting myself to calm myself down. But tonight, I don't even want to do that. Cutting only leaves me with bruises and no solutions. There is no solution, in fact. I am from that part of the world where a divorce is not the solution.

I have a great life: a lot of really close friends, I have really good grades at University (even got a job-offer before finishing my bachelor) and got enough money. The thing is, I am not happy. I were never happy. Not that I am not satisfied with everything (I really am), I just never felt joy for about 8 years.


I was never suicidal, friends helped a lot to prevent that, but lately suicide doesn't seem so odd anymore. Why should I continue a life, if I can't feel joy in it? Why should I go on, if not even a life that many people envy can make me happy in the slightest? I just don't see a reason.


I know that I should feel grateful for my life, but I just can't. I can't get motivation to do anything, because I know I won't feel any joy by doing it. I distract myself with videogames and work, but that won't do for long. I really hate myself, I hate, that I can't be happy with my life, I hate the way I think.

I still cannot break the habit no matter how hard I try. No matter what meditation or other mental exercise I do, it's a compulsion I cannot help.

I've dug and dug and still not found. So I pray. I need a miracle. I have to break free. I never want to hurt a child and I'm not even attracted to children (and don't even think about them except for trying to figure out how to break my addiction), but the videos are unbelievably addictive. I can't even imagine anything else having this level of hold over me. My problem is terrible compared to even the worst cases on /r/NoFap because I need to do it daily and it's children. *Children*. I can't believe it. I can't believe this is real.

Even if I break this finally... what do I do then? I have that in my past. How can I ever live with myself fully?

Every time I get a job, I quit shortly thereafter because I begin to resent my job and I can't get out of bed or start to call in too often.

When I got into college, I was excited to hopefully start my art career but no one wanted to help me sign for loans and so I had to leave school because I couldn't afford to go to a four-year university.

I thought maybe I could start a career but selling my art but no one is interested in hiring me or buying my paintings. I know I'm not the best but I was hoping that I could still sell some art and gradually get better. 

I have no family or friends to talk to. My SO is too busy with his career to be bothered by my problems.

7725,"26 years old who messed up everything...Hi there. Just looking for somebody to hear my story and get it out of my chest. 

I'm a 26 years old guy right now. During 2009, I enrolled in a medical school outside of my country. The normal time to complete my study are 6 years. I failed my first year study and had to repeat a year for it. Sadly, i failed it again but this time I did not tell my parents. I live a pretend life. I did not go to the uni, did not go to the exam andlost a lot of friends and a girl i love so much. I was lost and i did nothing about it. 

Now, i told my parents everything. I know how much i have failed them. Being the only son just made it hurt more. Seeing my friends the same age as me starting to get work, married and having children, I know i will never have all that. 

I was always fascinated by medicine but everytime i got the exam results, it does not potray it correctly. Why...

Thinking about suicide is for sure prohibitted in all religion but i can't stop thinking about it and putting me in a state of depression and denial. 

My parents said they need to face it as it is the reality right now. Regardless, I am still their son. I love them so much but why can't i show it to them? Why can't i appreciate them more? I have failed a lot of people who loves me so much.

3733,"Just hurt to much and I'm so tired.It's been 9 months since my wife of 15 years left. She started immediately (was most likely cheating) dating a friend of mine. They broke up a few months later. Now she's getting married to a different person, he is a great guy. My kids love him, as she likes to brag to me about. All our old friends, my own kids, even her family that I loved and was closer to me than my own, they all are thrilled about this engagement. 

I drank heavily when she left. For months. Ended up so depressed and drunk all the time that I went  to the ER because I wanted to kill myself. I spent 37 days in a facility doing counseling for my depression.

I got out and was feeling good again. Got a new job, got my own apartment (was forced to move back home with parents as I couldn't afford lawyer and rent etc.etc).. I thought I was turning the corner and my life was going to be ok. 

And then boom, it hits me all again. Like she just left yesterday. I'm so sad again.

It does take time and I am constantly being shown and opening doors to traumas that have been deep in my subconscious that do take a lot out of me, but I know its all for something greater. **Moment by moment, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, we heal. Together, Separately.**

Through our lived experiences though, they are meant to be shared and they are meant to be heard. The things that **you have lived through will always be different to what every single other person has lived through.** It takes time to share but once you start sharing, the **impact that it will leave, will be astonishing.** Our pain, our anxiety, depression etc., is meant to be face head on in our own time and then shared when the time is right, **so share, when you're ready.**

10396,"No offense, but I think being trans is kinda stupid. There are only 2 genders.

no ""switching genders"". you either have a penis or vagina. I just get really ticked off when someone changes their gender because they feel like it.

You can act however you want, you can date whoever you want, but someone can't just change their gender because it's ""the way you were supposed to be"". You were supposed to have whatever gender you were born with!

and I know there are people with imbalanced hormones, but that's not really a good reason to change something about theirself. hormones just change the way you act. If someone changes their gender because they want to fit in with people that act a certain way, they're fueling the gender divide even more. Because they change their gender for that reason, they're basically confirming that only certain genders can do certain things and should act certain ways. If both genders are equal, then why would someone change their gender?

It doesn't really give any advantage, it doesn't get you out of any problems they are currently in, there is no strategical reason for changing genders.

&amp;#x200B;

that only leaves the last reason: ""I change it because it's a personal choice""

Most likely you subconsciously correlate gender with doing things.

If you hang around girls a lot, you're might change your gender to a girl. That's because you want to identify as the people around you.

Rule 1: Trying to be cool is trying too hard and is not cool.

Rule 2: Biting into ice cream is a bad idea.

Rule 3: Trying to gulp down an entire can of soda in one go is also a bad idea.

I have a hard time hanging out with my friends and my girlfriend, doing my online classes, or really doing anything. I haven’t been able to think straight because of it. Which is what honestly prevents me from focusing on my education. I know if I really focus and work hard I can become the next Elon Musk. I just.. feel it in my gut. I’ve always thrived and been really interested in S.T.E.M. since childhood. I have a really solid plan to get there too. To become the next Elon Musk.

I feel like killing myself though, there’s a shotgun in the other room. That I’ve even picked up twice, sitting on my desk, fantasizing about blowing my brains and spraying the wall with my blood. But every time I do actually pick it up I get scared. And what about my family and friends? I really don’t want to hurt them. Would they be shocked? That the friend they thought would never even think about committing suicide, actually decides to blow his brains out. I wish I could just die in bed.

Finnancially, my parents don’t help me. I work myself to the bone. I have no time for social life. Only occasionally. I’ve given up my dreams and flew back here thinking my Dad was dying.

When I think about suicide I think about why I shouldn't do it and the reason I come up with is this. My parents had me when they were both 21. I'm sure I was an accident because both of my parents were poor and still are mostly. They were not prepared for me at all, at least that's what I think. When I look back at how hard it's been for them to raise me I get really sad. If I wasn't born they would've been able to enjoy their young lives but with me here I've costed them tons of money and time. If I killed myself now, all of that would've been waste. If I killed myself a huge portion of their life and time would be for no good reason. I think about it as if I were them. Would you want to put literally all of your money, love, and care into something and them be ungrateful enough for them to just kill themselves? For them to take what you did for granted and just go  like that? I would think no, no one would. It's just so sad. If I were never born they would've lived alright I think.

3901,"my brother attempted suicide last nightI live in a different state than my brother. I got an email from a woman saying she was a friend of my brother's and had stayed at his house last night. She woke up and went to say good-bye to him and he was incoherent. He admitted to taking a bottle of sleeping pills. She called 911. If she hadn't then he would be dead now.

I called the hospital, frantically trying to get information about him and the whole time just thinking ""He's dead. He's dead. They're going to tell me he's dead."" 

Luckily he failed in his attempt. He's stable and being transported to  a psychiatric unit. My mother and grandmother are driving across country (the also live in a completely different state) to see him. 

He had absolutely NO history of depression or mental illness that anyone knew of. He is the most level-headed, intelligent person I know. And I feel like I've just been punched in the gut. In a million years, I would NEVER have thought of him doing something like this. I'm so sad he didn't come to me for help. We've always been close. I'm so angry he put our family through this. I feel so helpless. So I'm just drinking and crying.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I'm just lost. My family is heart-broken and confused. I'm unable to go see him because of work and my own recent health issues.

That he can't tell just how much he was loved.

Sis: “That’s a pretty dress, Glorious.” 

Me: “Thank you.” 

Sis: “It makes your small titties look good.” *laughs*

Me: “... I don’t know why you’re talking, our boobs are the same size.”

Sis: “I know.” 

Me: “So... you just insulted me.” (Her tone and the way she laughed told me exactly what she meant when she said what she said.)

Sis: “No, I’ve come to accept my small boobs, you haven’t which is why you’re so mad.” 

Me: “This is why...” (I was about to say “This is why i like to pretend you don’t exist.” But then she would go crying to my mom, so I shut my mouth. 

I just sighed and started ignoring her. 

The end.

7767,"I think I might hang myself later.My dad and I got in a fight over a candle...he didn't like the smell of it (it's just cinnamon) and told me not to light it anymore, because I would fall asleep and burn the house down. 🤷‍♂️ despite me never laying in bed when I light it. I watch tv or browse the internet,  so the candle is always in site. I light it because it makes my room smell better. It smells humid or musty,  since it's all hardwood floors. I told him I wouldn't fall asleep, while it was lite and we got to arguing.  He said I was useless and that I just mooch off of him. He called me lazy because I sleep in. I told him that I haven't been the same after I lost my job. He just blamed me anyways for sleeping in. He complained about how i haven't found a job yet and that i suck all his money away. He also told me to get over feeling sad.

So i guess I'll get over being sad by hanging myself.  I am planning to hang myself in my closet with a belt. I may leave a note to him saying I'm not going to be wasting his money anymore. I'll do it later in the night, so if he comes in later (until he goes to bed) he won't find me in the process of it. Hopefully,  I'll be dead soon, that way I'm not wasting his money.

8775,"I wrote a love song ,for my imaginary gf ,(AKA:my pillow) 

It’s so nice to know 
That when I’m on the dark
You are there and have my back
Is comfortable to know that when I fall
I am gonna end up on your arms

It’s 10 o’clock ,Friday night 
And I got you in  my arms
I never thought I would be here
Lost in the moment, living the 
Life I always wanted , all those times
I had ,where I couldn’t see the light
Now ,now that all behind 

It was hard ,to get you 
It was hard to find you 
But your smile
The smile in your face
Just makes up for all it 

It’s so nice to know 
That when I’m on the dark
You are there and have my back
Is comfortable to know that when I fall
I am gonna end up on your arms

It nice to feel again this love
It’s nice to feel the pain leave my blood
It’s nice to leave this storm 
That saw  me grow ,
It’s been so long , 
Since the last time I could see, beyond my nose 
Since the Last time I could breathe ,between all this smoke 

It was hard ,to get you 
It was hard to find you 
But your smile
The smile in your face
Just makes up for all of it

9532,Balding want to end it all.I'm 28 and going bald and can't live with it anymore. Some people say shave your head and lift. Which doesn't feel me. Nor does the jacked up bald guy suit my personality one bit. Plus if I shaved my head being a pale skinny white guy I'd just look like a Neo-Nazi or cancer patient. The only hair style options for balding men is to either shave it or let it grow slightly out. Which makes you look like a 40 something accountant who's idea of fun is to reorganize his stamp collection. I'm terrified of leaving the house without a hat as I know everywhere I go people laugh at me for balding. I've given up on pursing women because no attractive women in her right mind wants to date a balding 20-something when 90% of guys in their 20's have full heads of hair. I can't go on with life like this anymore as I've gone from being considered good looking to ugly. I'm trying rogaine and if I don't see it working a year from now I'll just kill myself as I don't want to go through life as an ugly bald loser. And that's what baldness does to you. People give examples of how bald men are attractive but it's always hypermasculine guys like The Rock or Vin Diesel who are also in their 40's which is of no help for a guy in his 20's.,suicide,balding want to end it all i m 28 and going bald and can t live with it anymore some people say shave your head and lift which doesn t feel me nor does the jacked up bald guy suit my personality one bit plus if i shaved my head being a pale skinny white guy i d just look like a neo nazi or cancer patient the only hair style options for balding men is to either shave it or let it grow slightly out which makes you look like a 40 something accountant who s idea of fun is to reorganize his stamp collection i m terrified of leaving the house without a hat as i know everywhere i go people laugh at me for balding i ve given up on pursing women because no attractive women in her right mind wants to date a balding 20 something when 90 of guys in their 20 s have full heads of hair i can t go on with life like this anymore as i ve gone from being considered good looking to ugly i m trying rogaine and if i don t see it working a year from now i ll just kill myself as i don t want to go through life as an ugly bald loser and that s what baldness does to you people give examples of how bald men are attractive but it s always hypermasculine guys like the rock or vin diesel who are also in their 40 s which is of no help for a guy in his 20 s ,267
10020,"Please don't do it.My mom just told me someone I knew commited suicide today. I'm heartbroken. They left a young daughter behind, and with no one to take care of her now, she'll probably go to a home. This person was amazing and I was planning on seeing them next month. 

I just wanted to say this to anyone reading this post and thinking about it,

Please don't do it. 

Not because some random stranger on the internet told you to, but for yourself. You deserve to see just how amazing life can get if you hold on a bit longer. Death is a given, but it doesn't have to come so soon. There's just too much of life you haven't experienced yet. It's too soon. You don't belong there, not yet. 

No matter what your life looks right now, it's worth fighting through it. It always gets better, but only if you stay here to witness that.

You are strong enough and you can get through this. 

No matter what life throws at you, you can survive it. 

There is hope, there is help, and there are a lot of people that want you here, and people that will want you there in the future.

I hope I meet you someday, friend.

15147,"Bliss used to be niceLet me just start off as I thought I had everything, but it seemed to just be a lie.

I had friends, but they are no where. I try my best to initiate and talk, not just that; I try and I plan things to do. I get ignored. Everyone ignores me, things seem pointless of course. I did try making other friends, but of course... I didn't have hope, along with family, with they always fight. 

I am told I was a disappointment many times, from people I care about to family. I know it's just me, who can I blame. I am ghost, if I was hated that means someone cares to take that time out their day. 

Life was getting me down, I didn't have anything. Until I met someone, but it seemed to be a lie. Even in the end, I really meant little to nothing. Even when I clung on to the happiness I had. I try to do what I can, to be the best as they would like.

The only real thing I have is cancer, I don't want it to take me. I rather do it myself. I try to fight, I try to do my best, to not give up... but look all that hurt. Things are pointless and I can't trust anyone.
