2,"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",suicide,"ex wife threatening suiciderecently i left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that i have decided to refuse to go back to her as of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide i have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe i ll come back i know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? what do i do and how am i supposed to handle her death on my hands? i still love my wife but i cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure i m worried today may be the day she does it and i hope so much it doesn t happen "

9,"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.

11,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

12,"[Trigger warning] Excuse for self inflicted burns*I do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attack.
*I know it's not a healthy thing to do.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.) He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine? 

I do not want to self harm again, I just need to be able to explain this.",suicide," trigger warning excuse for self inflicted burns i do know the crisis line and used it after when i was having a panic attack  i know it s not a healthy thing to do  but, i did i did something stupid out of impulse i burned myself  i really need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history we were together 12 years  he s seen my at my worst  but i had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, i m thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts   i did work on my car last night and i hadn t self harmed in a long time i just did it without thinking, as usual impulse and lost in the moment  should i say i touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? i have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist they are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep  i think the car excuse is a good one but i would need to say what i was working on to explain the 3 burns maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when i went to fix it i touched the engine?  i do not want to self harm again, i just need to be able to explain this "

16,"Everyone wants to be ""edgy"" and it's making me self conscious I feel like I don't stand out. I can draw yes and play the guitar but I honestly feel like am stuck in the past, my taste in music are all rock and alt metal from
2000's to the 90's and it doesn't really make me feel unique it's just my style but seeing as my friends and classmates getting more into rap and EDM it's hard for me to feel like I fit in.
The I don't feel like I stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if I do that I'd be just another
""Quirky kid"" who's in a cringey phase.
Many of my friends say that I look good in grunge style and I kinda agree but it's hard for me to continue that if I can't even stand out from all the ""edgy

18,"My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE. I have bipolar, depression and crippling social anxiety. Balding has been the cherry on top. I wear a hat 24/7 even in my room when I’m alone because I can’t stop thinking about it. I pop Xanax all day to try and numb the pain and it works for a little bit but it all comes crashing back twice as hard once I come down. I don’t know how to communicate with people anymore and I don’t know how to keep a relationship. I used to be one of the “popular kids” but after my dad passed away I feel into a deep dark hole. I’ve been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didn’t have them I’d be dead long ago. But it’s getting to the point where even their love and support isn’t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore.

In the end, my desire to self-terminate grows stronger.  I have so little left now, but still have the same bitterness, just a bit stronger now.
