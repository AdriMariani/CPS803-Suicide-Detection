2,"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",suicide,"ex wife threatening suiciderecently i left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that i have decided to refuse to go back to her as of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide i have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe i ll come back i know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? what do i do and how am i supposed to handle her death on my hands? i still love my wife but i cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure i m worried today may be the day she does it and i hope so much it doesn t happen "

9,"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.

11,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.)

 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine?

32,"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don’t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

Goodbye,

Steven  ",suicide,"trapped inside a voiddear whoever cares enough to read this, though i doubt there are any that fall under that criteria  i am trapped inside a void  there is absolutely nothing for me  i go through the monotonous tasks of every day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever  the only saving grace i felt like i had, the only thing that made me feel like i was wanted, and accepted me for who i am, was maren  as absolutely idiotic as it sounds and shes assured me that it is, talking to her was the one thing i looked forward to every day  it was the one thing that kept me going knowing that some time throughout the day i would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep  she made me feel accepted  she made me feel like i had some kind of worth  she made me feel like i could actually like myself, and be okay with who i was  but most of all, she made me feel loved  never before have i ever been able to open up to someone so completely  i felt completely at ease when talking with her  ive told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them that she cared about me  we shared many intimate moments that i would never dare have with anyone else  we talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together  we talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart  except for ty  she helped me through all of the problems i was facing related to my depression over the break up with starr  she talked to me whenever i needed her, and she always made me feel better about it  she was my shining star in a pitch black sky  none of this is any longer, though  we have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how i am  i am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and i dont blame her  i do nothing but hurt her these days  none of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless  when we first started talking again, i told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that  i suppose she thought i was over exaggerating, but i wasnt  i need to have interaction in my life  i know it is not fair to the people around me, and i know that it is not what they want, but i cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time  my thoughts are extremely self destructive  i need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts   for about four months i was legitimately happy  that was probably the only time in my life i have ever actually been legitimately happy  i was finally over starr, thanks to the help from maren  i had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between  i was in love, and i felt loved  if i could go back in time and re play those four months over and over again, i would without hesitation  that was the best time of my life  i didnt have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control  i didnt have to feel like i had to hold all of my feelings inside  i could share them with maren, and she was incredibly receptive  i didnt have to lie about who i was, or leave details out  maren made me feel like i was a good person  i told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me  she tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things i have been told about myself  she told me that i was attractive, something i had never been told before, not even by starr, who i was together with for ten years  i was happy with who i was at that time  prior to that i had never willingly taken a picture of myself  but with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like i wasnt the hideous person that i thought myself to be  in hindsight, i am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think i was attractive  it was still nice to hear it, though  i miss those days  i long for them to return, but i know that that will never happen  the same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme  they are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high maintenance and fucked up i am  that causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives  that was the case with starr  the night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me  in the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again  after ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend  the same thing is happening with maren  i am driving her away, and eventually i will not have a best friend again  i will be completely alone  the last time i was completely alone, right after starr broke up with me, i didnt leave my room for two weeks  i didnt eat a single thing in those two weeks  i laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where i had gone wrong  i have never cried so much in my life  i have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment i could not contain them any longer  i had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how i feel again, right now  it was complete luck that i was actually able to reconnect with maren again  i have no idea at all how to make friends  she just happened to be online on facebook when i was feeling at my absolute lowest  i sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, i was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away  that didnt happen though  we had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood  i dont remember how the subject got changed to me talking about starr, but i told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it  she stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on facebook  i was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because i was still upset about the breakup, but also because i couldnt believe that someone actually cared  especially someone i hadnt talked to in over a decade  when we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a red string of fate  i dont believe in fate, but i also dont think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when i felt like i had nothing left  the problem lies in the fact that i will never be able to replicate that with anyone else  i am incredibly socially awkward i cannot make new friends at all  in person i just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety  online, i just have nothing to say  i am a boring person  i have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like  i have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship  they all stopped talking to me after one session  i dont have anything at all to give in a friendship  after fighting with maren, and being told that i cant keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all i asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching game of thrones with her new boyfriend who was her ex, my self worth is absolutely rock bottom  she has made me realise that i am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve  she joined me in blaming starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but i see now that it was never her fault  i am just completely unlovable  i can never have more than one true friend  i believe this stems from the fact that growing up, i had very few friends, and when i tried to expand and make new friends i got burned very badly, every time  because of this, i latch on to the one friend i have  i suffocate them  i bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me  i have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever i try, i get extremely depressed  i have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression  i was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else  every time i ask her to do something and she says no, i get a sinking feeling  mainly because in the four months that i was happy, we did everything together  any time i asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with

33,"Posting Galadriel’s opening monologue every day until I get a girlfriend Day 3 Galadriel: (speaking partly in Elvish)

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

(Han matho ne nen.)

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",non-suicide,"posting galadriels opening monologue every day until i get a girlfriend day 3 galadriel  speaking partly in elvish  i amar prestar aen  the world is changed  han matho ne nen  i feel it in the water  han mathon ned cae  i feel it in the earth  a han noston ned gwilith  i smell it in the air  much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it  it began with the forging of the great rings three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls and nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men, who above all else desire power for within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race but they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made deep in the land of mordor, in the fires of mount doom, the dark lord sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life  one ring to rule them all  one by one, the free lands of middle earth fell to the power of the ring, but there were some who resisted a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor, and on the very slopes of mount doom, they fought for the freedom of middle earth victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone it was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that isildur, son of the king, took up his fathers sword  sauron, enemy of the free peoples of middle earth, was defeated the ring passed to isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted and the ring of power has a will of its own it betrayed isildur, to his death  and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost history became legend legend became myth and for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer  it came to the creature gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains and there it consumed him the ring gave to gollum unnatural long life for five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of gollums cave, it waited darkness crept back into the forests of the world rumor grew of a shadow in the east, whispers of a nameless fear, and the ring of power perceived its time had come it abandoned gollum, but then something happened that the ring did not intend it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable a hobbit, bilbo baggins, of the shire  for the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all "

I been trying to deal with my depression with therapy and meds but I don't think they are really working. 

This all came to the forefront since I quit my job to start a business with two friends but everyday I feel like we made a huge mistake and we are going to lose everything.

107,"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",suicide,"anyone planning suicide in the long term future?i m a depressed 22f who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4 5 years why do i want to kill myself? it s kind of a long story but the main reasons are a combination  lack of economic stability, health problems, family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life   economic   growing up was hard and i ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household, mother dying at a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc , like a lot of people here i m in college currently, but found that although i genuinely love learning and picked a stem major, college just seems very oppressive i know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial my parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school or even cc for a few years i had relatively good grades in high school  i knew from the moment i was on campus that i hated it lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, i didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired i thought about transferring, but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student , so i stuck it out though i was depressed i did well academically but since my major/department is kinda shitty applied math , i m worried that i won t get a good paying job, unlike engineering students like had i known earlier, i would have just majored in that instead i will leave college next year with about 25 28k in loans   family   generally, i strongly dislike my family life my other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could my mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids, even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement i haven t come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it  not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family oriented  my parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here   health  i have a lot of chronic, probably genetically caused, health diseases since i was young when i was young and in my mid teens, i was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive after my mom died, my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore, my health has decreased it s hard at college too, because i don t have a car, and i didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone so my health continues to decrease these aren t life threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious  so because of all this, i find it hard to justify continuing life i am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife i don t want to kill myself yet, but in 3 4 years, when i can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once i m in the real world  i ve seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even it seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years and it s hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life, when it s a constant struggle for me and even if i can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what s the point? why suffer and struggle so much in life if i don t really see a reason too? basically i created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future i m also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or expanding on the reasons above, though i doubt people can change my mind  tl dr want to wait 3 4 years before committing suicide basically i personally see life worth living if i m economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy however, for a multitude of complex reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me i am also a nihilist, atheist and don t see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living "

110,"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",suicide,"screenwriting course scripts and characters that commit suicide and other parts of dealing with depression i ve been a little low lately, so this matters to me i m long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little  i wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when i was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized and now, as i am in the class that comes after that basic course, i have to finish the script i like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me  but today i had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide it was like i was seeing myself doing his actions there is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line i wrote was the ideas that i had in my head it was like writing down my thoughts, from the past too easy to write, which meant i could zoom past it faster, but i could never watch this script come to life it would be too traumatic i couldn t let other people see that too especially people who know what its like  i know it isn t the same, now that i m much better, but i feel like i could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that i was hesitating and that i wouldn t do it confused if that was really what i wanted  another complexity i feel like i ve become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti depressants, and depression within my class too many scripts don t get it right it s never as straightforward as they write it even now, it s not straightforward a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself a larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that i fall back into depression an even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment s notice, to just stop pain and now i will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound we will see how much it bothers me i don t think it will too much, but who knows, right? someone in my class wasn t clear about what the character was doing accident or attempt  to me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well  i guess i ll have to tell her that there s no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent  my life keeps getting more and more complex the farther i am from the epicenter of my depression not that i don t have depression getting much closer to stable though  i know this is long, and i though this isn t entirely related but i just wanted to show this to people who know what it s like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it "

118,"I feel so hopelessHello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

The past few months have been especially hard for some reason.  I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better).  I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

131,"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?
",suicide,"i think i need to check myself into a hospital i need your guys advice 4 weeks ago i got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder it wasn t really news, i ve known i ve been depressed for years approaching 3 1/2 years now  i got prescribed zoloft, and i m up to 75mg now i ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now its not working though if anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it s not even getting worse at a slower rate  over the last few years i ve made a lot of changes to try to help i went from 198 to 150, i started eating healthier, i changed majors to something that i both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, i transferred colleges since the first one wasn t working out, i joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, i even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything now i ve finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric  and none of it has helped if anything, its only gotten worse since i don t even have the hope that any more changes will help the hope is gone when i was a kid, i used to get pneumonia a lot i had it like 5 times before i was 3 i wish i d have just died back then, i could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now i have a ton of other people to drag down with me  the latest i think i would be happy if   thing has been getting in a relationship i think i m thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes i haven t yet made, and because i pretty genuinely hate myself i ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my gpa, i don t really believe in inherent self worth  i m almost 21 now and haven t ever been on a date, let alone received a non platonic hug nobody ever expresses interest in me, i always have to initiate thought i ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if i don t initiate i d never get invited to anything  i can t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit it s not like i can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since i still have classes to go to it feels like all the changes i ve made over the years have amounted to nothing  i m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time i haven t been able to cry in years, so i just self harm when i feel like crying it s not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn t give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense besides, it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably i much prefer being drunk to not being drunk  all my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers it feels like i ve gotten left behind on the road of life everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love i get pms from one of my friends from high school asking me if i ve started dating yet i keep trying to explain to him that i m trying but not having any luck whenever dating comes up, that s all i ever get i m sure you ll find someone eventually  thing is, none of the i d might be happy if   things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left i can make, since professional and medical help has failed  i don t enjoy anything anymore dota 2 and csgo feel like chores, eu4 is too frustrating now i ve already played through all the rpgs i enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through i don t enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year i don t have any shows i really enjoy i ve always wanted to learn to draw, i m actually a huge fan of furry art, but i m pretty bad and i m a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that i pretty much can t do it and get better  suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better the logic i mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so i d be better off i used to think ok, i ll wait until i turn 30, and then i ll kill myself if things haven t improved  however, as things have deteriorated, i ve moved that up to 25 more recently, i ve moved it up to after graduation i m thinking it could be my own graduation present to myself  i don t even know how i m going to make it that far suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something i have to do  i don t buy the whole it gets better thing anymore its been over 3 years it really doesn t in my experience all the medical advice i ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself i don t understand to what end though?

132,"I want to do it but even finding a way to do this is difficult. This is the plan that I've come up with so far.Will it work? I don't want to stay alive but be disabled. I want this to work. Where I live, it's very hard for me to find a way to end my life without causing me too much pain.

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

I'm 24 and I am a pharmacy student. The place where I live and my social skills - or lack thereof - don't allow me to get my hands on opioids, or other ways of dying peacefully. 

I'm not here to talk about why I want this. I know many of you know the feeling.

139,"Shopping IS AWFUL Finally was allowed to go out to London, a place other than trees and forests (I’ve only been on picnics for 5 months)

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, there’s these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you can’t actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I can’t touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I don’t think I want to go back to shopping ever again if that’s how uncomfortable it’s going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and it’s scary.

That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.


I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.


“Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”


The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.


“Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”


Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


“How would she react?”


“What would the funeral look like?”


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.
