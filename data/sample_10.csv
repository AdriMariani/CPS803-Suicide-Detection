9670,"I think this might be my suicide letterI wrote this a while back, but my feelings haven't changed.

&amp;#x200B;

 Can't really think of a reason to get out of bed today. I think this might be what a downward spiral is all about. Anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life.

&amp;#x200B;

The want to want.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never been a driven guy. I have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo. I chose what university to go to with little to no research, I chose a major simply because I had to, I am who I am, where I am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is I don’t want that. I have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking. With the GPA I have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim. I’ll get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title that’ll do little but stroke my ego because in reality I’ll spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk. I see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but I can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a self made millionaire, born in a small European town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all A\*s (I remember my sister crying because she only got an A on something in school, she thought she’d never go to university.) Me? I pat myself on the back when I go to all my classes in a week, or when I didn’t do as bad on the test I didn’t study for as I thought I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m constantly surrounded by people who’s average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward. I have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, I have found myself simply drifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m not sure where to go from here. I am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it. I want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but I don’t. Every second of every day feels like I am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldn’t be just waiting.",suicide,"i think this might be my suicide letter i wrote this a while back, but my feelings haven't changed can't really think of a reason to get out of bed today i think this might be what a downward spiral is all about anyway, hope some of you can relate, see you in another life i have never been a driven guy i have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo i chose what university to go to with little to no research, i chose a major simply because i had to, i am who i am, where i am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society the issue is i dont want that i have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking with the gpa i have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim ill get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title thatll do little but stroke my ego because in reality ill spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk i see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but i can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by my father is a self made millionaire, born in a small european town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all i remember is my sister crying because she only got an a on something in school, she thought shed never go to university me? i pat myself on the back when i go to all my classes in a week, or when i didnt do as bad on the test i didnt study for as i thought i had.  im constantly surrounded by people whos average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward i have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, i have found myself simply drifting i guess im not sure where to go from here i am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it i want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but i dont every second of every day feels like i am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldnt be just waiting ",489
2776,"Ones Around (98) We start at 0. We all start at ground zero. We all start with one goal, one focus, one passion. Someone telling you can't do it? Keep quiet and show them you can. Release the need to live for others expectations and what they want you to do, **you know what you want to do.**

Grind, Hustle, put every living breath into what the **FUCK** you want to do, **FUCK** the noise. Remember, just because you are losing at half, doesn't mean you won't win by the end of the game. Game forever. Marathon Focused. Remember that we are all on our own highways. One lane highway. Focus on what **YOU** love to do &amp; **YOU ONLY.**

If it isn't working for you? Pivot. Try something new. Don't quit, don't give up, whats the point of that? We have 1 life, many opportunities, many chances, so what you failed? so what you tried and it didn't go the way you wanted? so what? Is that **GOING TO STOP YOU?** Better Not. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and lets get to it. **NOW.**

I believe in you, I believe in trying, trying and then after that? You got it, Trying again. Failures are only failures if there is nothing learned from the situation. **TRY AGAIN.** It will all work out, stay focused on what **YOU** are passionate about. Put your everything into, blood, sweat, tears, pain, joy, **EVERYTHING.** 

**Get to it.** The world is counting on you.

I love you.

15147,"Bliss used to be niceLet me just start off as I thought I had everything, but it seemed to just be a lie.

I had friends, but they are no where. I try my best to initiate and talk, not just that; I try and I plan things to do. I get ignored. Everyone ignores me, things seem pointless of course. I did try making other friends, but of course... I didn't have hope, along with family, with they always fight. 

I am told I was a disappointment many times, from people I care about to family. I know it's just me, who can I blame. I am ghost, if I was hated that means someone cares to take that time out their day. 

Life was getting me down, I didn't have anything. Until I met someone, but it seemed to be a lie. Even in the end, I really meant little to nothing. Even when I clung on to the happiness I had. I try to do what I can, to be the best as they would like.

The only real thing I have is cancer, I don't want it to take me. I rather do it myself. I try to fight, I try to do my best, to not give up... but look all that hurt. Things are pointless and I can't trust anyone. 

Used to laugh and joke all the time, with a smile on my face, with positivity. Taking the day without any problems and I could handle anything. You can guess how I changed.

Thank you",suicide,"bliss used to be nicelet me just start off as i thought i had everything, but it seemed to just be a lie  i had friends, but they are no where i try my best to initiate and talk, not just that i try and i plan things to do i get ignored everyone ignores me, things seem pointless of course i did try making other friends, but of course  i didn t have hope, along with family, with they always fight  i am told i was a disappointment many times, from people i care about to family i know it s just me, who can i blame i am ghost, if i was hated that means someone cares to take that time out their day  life was getting me down, i didn t have anything until i met someone, but it seemed to be a lie even in the end, i really meant little to nothing even when i clung on to the happiness i had i try to do what i can, to be the best as they would like  the only real thing i have is cancer, i don t want it to take me i rather do it myself i try to fight, i try to do my best, to not give up  but look all that hurt things are pointless and i can t trust anyone  used to laugh and joke all the time, with a smile on my face, with positivity taking the day without any problems and i could handle anything you can guess how i changed  thank you",266
